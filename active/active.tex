\section*{Author Summary}
In this paper, we develop and analyze a minimal model for 2D active networks based on the cortical cytoskeleton of eukaryotic embryos.  Our model introduces a drag-like slip between cross-linked filaments as means to dissipate stored stress, generating a macroscopic effective viscosity.  We further introduce an active friction to active stress from microscopic properties.  We generate computational simulations based on the model, and demonstrate that active stress is sufficient to drive network contraction only temporarily.  By introducing filament recycling, we are able to set up steady state flow profiles such as those found in the cortex of developing embryos and migrating cells.  The model is used to calculate phenomenological constants measured in prior experiments.  Our analysis sheds insight on potential microscopic control parameters governing broad qualitative differences in 2D active networks.  We make our model freely accessible and our methodology transparent to enable other researchers to clearly understand our modeling framework and to build upon our findings.

\section*{Introduction}

\paragraph{}  Cortical flow is a fundamental and ubiquitous form of cellular deformation that underlies cell polarization, cell division, cell crawling and multicellular tissue morphogenesis\cite{cellmech_flows3,cellmech_flows2}.  These flows arise within the actomyosin cortex, a thin layer of cross-linked actin filaments and myosin motors that lies just beneath the plasma membrane \cite{Salbreux2012536}. The active forces that drive cortical flows are thought to be generated by myosin motors pulling against individual actin filaments \cite{Munro2004413}. These forces must be integrated within cross-linked networks to build macroscopic contractile stress.  At the same time, cross-linked networks resist deformation and this resistance must be dissipated by network remodeling to allow macroscopic network deformation and flow.  How force production and dissipation depend on motor activity, network architecture and remodeling remains poorly understood.

Current models for cortical flow rely on coarse-grained descriptions of actomyosin networks as active fluids, whose motions are driven by gradients of active contractile stress and opposed by an effectively viscous resistance\cite{cellmech_flows}.  In these models, gradients of active stress are assumed to reflect spatial variation in motor activity and viscous resistance is assumed to reflect the internal dissipation of elastic resistance due to local remodeling of filaments and/or cross-links \cite{PhysRevLett.106.028103}.  A key virtue of these models is that their behavior is governed by a few parameters (active stress and effective viscosity).  By coupling an active fluid description to simple kinetic models for network assembly and disassembly and making active stress and effective viscosity depend on e.g network density and turnover rates, it is possible to capture phenomenological descriptions of cortical flow.  Models based on this active fluids description can successfully reproduce spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical flow observed during polarization \cite{cellmech_flows}, cell division \cite{Turlier2014114,PhysRevLett.103.058102}, cell motility \cite{Keren:2009aa,RevModPhys.85.1143} and tissue morphogenesis \cite{Heisenberg2013948}.  

However, to understand how cells exert physiological control over cortical deformation and flow, or to build and tune networks with desired properties {\em in vitro}, it is essential to connect this coarse-grained description to the microscopic origins of force generation and dissipation within cross-linked actomyosin networks.  Both active stress and effective viscosity depend sensitively on microscopic parameters including densities of filaments, motors and cross-links, force-dependent motor/filament interactions, cross-link dynamics and network turnover rates.  Thus a key challenge is to understand how tuning these microscopic parameters controls the dynamic interplay between active force generation and passive relaxation to control macroscopic dynamics of cortical flow.

\paragraph{} Studies in living cells have documented fluid-like stress relaxation on timescales of 10-100s of seconds \cite{cellmech_flows,cellmech_flows2,cellmech_flows3,rheo_fluid,rheo_fluid2,cell_rheo_exp}.  These modes of stress relaxation are thought to arise both from the transient binding/unbinding of individual cross-links and from the turnover (assembly/disassembly) of actin filaments (ref).  Studies of cross-linked and/or bundled actin networks {\em in vitro} suggest that cross-link unbinding may be sufficient to support viscous relaxation (creep) on very long timescales\cite{rheo_crosslinksmatter,rheo_crosslinkslip1,rheo_crosslinkslip2,rheo_crosslinkslip3,rheo_nonaffine}, but is unlikely to explain the rapid large scale cortical deformation and flow observed in living cells.  It has been proposed in the field that rapid actin turnover must play a significant role as well. Indeed, photokinetic and single molecule imaging studies studies reveal rapid turnover of cortical actin filaments in living cells on timescales of 10-100 seconds \cite{Robin:2014aa}. Previous theoretical models have explored  the dependence of stress relaxation on cross-link binding and unbinding analytically \cite{theo_crosslinkslip1,theo_crosslinkslip2} and others have explicitly modeled reversible cross-linking in combination with complex mechanics of filament bundles \cite{model_taeyoon,rheo_crosslinkslip2,theo_crosslinkslip3}.  However, until very recently \cite{Mak:2016aa} very little attention has been paid to actin turnover as mechanism of stress relaxation. 

Recent work has also begun to reveal insights into mechanisms that govern active stress generation in disordered actomyosin networks. In vitro studies have confirmed that local interactions among actin filaments and myosin motors are sufficient to drive macroscopic contraction of disordered networks \cite{rheo_2D1}.  Theoretical studies suggest that asymmetrical compliance of actin filaments (stiffer under extension than compression) and spatial differences (dispersion) in motor activity are sufficient conditions for contraction in one \cite{1367-2630-14-3-033037} and two \cite{PhysRevX.4.041002} dimensional networks, although other routes to contractility may also exist \cite{PhysRevX.4.041002}.  Further work has explored how modulation of network architecture, cross-link dynamics and motor density, activity and assembly state can shape rates and patterns of network deformation \cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0039869,Alvarado:2013aa,C0SM00494D} or network rheology \cite{0295-5075-85-1-18007,rheo_active}.  

Significantly, {\em in vitro} models for disordered actomyosin networks have used stable actin filaments, and these networks support only transient contraction, either because of network collapse\cite{Alvarado:2013aa}, or buildup of elastic resistance (ref? I don't know about this one), or because network rearrangements (polarity sorting) dissipate the potential to generate contractile force \cite{Ndlec:1997aa,Surrey1167}. This suggest that continuous turnover of actin filaments may play a key role in allowing sustained deformation and flow. Recent theoretical and modeling studies have begun to explore how this could work \cite{2015arXiv150706182H,Mak:2016aa,10.1371/journal.pone.0000696}, and to explore dynamic behaviors that can emerge in contractile material with turnover \cite{PhysRevLett.113.148102}. However, there is much to learn about how the buildup and maintenance of contractile force during continuous deformation and flow depends local interplay of network architecture, motor activity and filament turnover.



\paragraph{}  The goal of this work was to build a computational bridge between the microscopic description of cross-linked actomyosin networks and the coarse grained macroscopic description of an active fluid.  We sought to capture the essential microscope features (dynamic cross-links, active motors and semi flexible actin filaments with asymmetric compliance and continuous filament recycling), but in a way that is sufficiently simple to allow systematic exploration of how parameters that govern network deformation and flow in an active fluid theory depend on microscopic parameters. To this end, we introduce several coarse-grained approximations into our representation of filament networks. First, we represent semi-flexible actin filaments as chains of simple springs with asymmetric compliance (stronger in extension than compression). Second, we replace  dynamic binding/unbinding of elastic cross-links with a coarse-grained representation in terms of molecular friction \cite{theo_friction,theo_frictionSam,theo_molefric}, such that filaments can slide past each other against a constant fictional resistance. Third, we used a similar scheme to introduce active motors at filament crossover points with a simple linear force/velocity relationship, and we introduce dispersion of motor activity by making only a subset of filament overlaps active \cite{theo_frictionShila}.  Finally, we model filament turnover by regularly reseting a subset of filaments to a new unstrained position. Importantly, these simplification allows us to extend our single polymer models to dynamical systems of larger network models for direct comparison between theory and modeling results. This level of coarse graining will therefore make it easier to understand classes of behavior for varying compositions of cross-linked filament networks. In addition, it allows us to compute a new class of numerical simulations efficiently, which gives us concrete predictions for behaviors in widely different networks with measurable dependencies on molecular details.

Our goal was to model essential microscope features of cross-linked actomyosin networks (semi flexible actin filaments with asymmetric compliance, dynamic cross-links, active motors and and continuous filament recycling), in a way that is simple enough to allow systematic exploration of how tuning these microscopic features controls macroscopic network deformation and flow. We focus on 2D networks for computational tractability and because they capture a reasonable approximation of the quasi-2D cortical actomyosin networks that govern flow and deformation in many eukaryotic cells\cite{cellmech_flows}, or the quasi-2D networks used in recent in vitro studies\cite{rheo_2D1,rheo_2D2}.


\subsection*{Asymmetric filament compliance}
We model individual filaments as chains of springs with relaxed length $l_s$.  Filaments can therefore be represented as a sequence of nodes with positions $\mathbf{x_i}$ and nearest neighbor force interactions, $\mathbf{F^{\mu}_i}$, of the form

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:spring}
|F^{\mu}_i| = \mu\cdot\frac{|\mathbf{x_{i+1}}-\mathbf{x_i}|-l_s}{l_s} +\mu\cdot\frac{|\mathbf{x_{i-1}}-\mathbf{x_i}|-l_s}{l_s}
\end{equation}





where the modulus, $\mu$, is a composite quantity representing both filament and cross-linker compliance in a manner similar to a proposed effective medium theory \cite{theo_crosslinknonlinear}.   To model asymmetric filament compliance, we assign the modulus $\mu$, a different value depending on whether $|\mathbf{x_{i-1}}-\mathbf{x_i}|-l_s$ (the strain) is greater or less than 0. In the limit of highly rigid cross-links and flexible filaments, our model reduces to the pure semi-flexible filament models of \cite{theo_hlm,theo_hlm2}.  In the opposite regime of nearly rigid filaments and highly flexible cross links, our method is still largely similar to the model of \cite{theo_crosslinknonlinear} in small strain regimes before any nonlinear cross link stiffening.  In a departure from those models, we assume here that the magnitude of the force on interior cross-links is the same as those on the exterior.  This approach ignores the variation in strain on these two sets of cross-links as addressed in \cite{theo_crosslinknonlinear}, but we choose to ignore this variation in favor of an approximated, global mean approach.  



\subsection*{Drag-like coupling between overlapping filaments}
\label{exp_drag}
Previous models represent cross-linkers as elastic connections between pairs of points on neighboring filaments that appear and disappear with either fixed or strain-dependent probabilities \cite{model_taeyoon,theo_crosslinknonlinear}.  Here, we introduce a simpler coarse-grained model for dynamic cross-links by replacing many transient elastic interactions with an effective drag-like coupling between every pair of overlapping segments.
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:drag}
\mathbf{F^{\xi}_i} = \xi \cdot \int^{s_{i+1}}_{s_{i-1}} ds \frac{l_s-|s-s_i|}{l_s} \: (\mathbf{v_i}-\mathbf{v_j}) \: p_{ij}(s)
\end{equation}

Where $p_{ij}(s)$ represents the locational distribution of cross-link points (equal to 1 at locations of cross-links and 0 elsewhere) and $\mathbf{v_i}$ and $\mathbf{v_j}$ represent the velocities of the $i$th and $j$th filament segment.  This model assumes a linear relation between applied force and the velocity difference between attached segments.  This drag-like coupling has been shown to be an adequate approximation in the case of ionic cross-linking of actin\cite{mol_fric,theo_hydroish2}, and can be found in the theoretical basis of force-velocity curves for myosin bound filaments\cite{theo_frictionShila}. Although non-linearities can arise through force dependent detachment kinetics and/or non-linear force extension of cross-links, we assume that inhomogeneities from non-linear effects are of second or higher order. With this assumption, the motion of filaments can be described by a dynamical equation of the form

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:syst1}
L\zeta\mathbf{ v_i} +\mathbf{F^{\xi}_i}= \mathbf{F^{\mu}_i}
\end{equation}

Here, the first term in the integral is the filament's intrinsic drag through its embedding fluid, $\zeta$, while the second comes from the drag-like coupling between filaments, $\xi$.  

\subsection*{Active coupling for motor driven filament interactions}

To add motor activity we select a subset of cross-linked points and impart an additional force of magnitude $\upsilon$ directed in the orientations of the individual filaments, $\mathbf{u_i}$.  This leads to a modification of the equation of motion to

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:moto}
\mathbf{F^{\upsilon}_i}= \mathbf{\hat{u}_i}\cdot\upsilon\int ds \sum _j \:  \frac{l_s-|s-s_i|}{l_s} p_{ij}q_{ij}
\end{equation}

In this formulation, only at the subset of points where  $p_{ij}=1$ and $q_{ij}=1$ will there be a force imparted.  In our simulations we let $q_{ij}$ be selected randomly such that $\bar{q}=\phi$, where $\bar{q}$ indicates the mean of $q$.

Finally, for each active force, $\mathbf{F^{\upsilon}_j}$, imparted by filament $j$, we must also impart the opposite force onto the filament $i$ as well.  Therefore, the entire force balance equation with activity will appear as

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:syst3}
L\zeta\mathbf{ v_i} +\mathbf{F^{\xi}_i}= \mathbf{F^{\mu}_i}+\mathbf{F^{\upsilon}_i} - \sum_{j}\mathbf{F^{\upsilon}_j}p_{ij}q_{ij}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{2D network formation}

We used a mikado model approach \cite{Unterberger2014} to initialize a minimal network of connected unstressed linear filaments in a rectangular 2D domain. We generate 2D networks of these semi-flexible filaments by laying down straight lines of length, L, with random position and orientation. We then assume that overlapping filaments become cross-linked at their points of overlap. Although real cytoskeletal networks may form with non-negligible anisotropy, for simplicity, we focus on isotropically initialized networks. We define the density using the average distance between cross-links along a filament, $l_c$. A simple geometrical argument can then be used to derive the number of filaments filling a domain as a function of $L$ and $l_c$\cite{theo_hlm}.  Here, we use the approximation that the number of filaments needed to tile a rectangular domain of size $W \times H$  is $2WH/Ll_c$, and that the length density is therefore simply, $1/l_c$. In the absence of cross-link slip, we expect the network to form a connected solid with a well defined elastic modulus\cite{theo_hlm,theo_hlm2}.


\subsection*{System of equations for applied stress}
We model our full network as a coupled system of differential equations satisfying \ref{eqn:syst3}.  Although the general mechanical response of this system may be very complex, we focus our attention on low frequency deformations and the steady-state creep response of the system to an applied stress.  To do this we introduce a fixed stress, $\sigma$ along one edge of the network.  The stress is applied via individual forces to the filaments lying within a patch of size $D_w$ such that the sum of individual forces is equal to the applied stress times the height of the domain.  These forces points in the direction, $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$, producing and extension of the patch.

Finally, we add a 0 velocity constraint at the other edge of our domain of interest.  We assume that our network is in the "dry," low Reynold's number limit, where inertial effects are so small that we can equate our total force to 0.  Therefore, we have a dynamical system of wormlike chain filaments satisfying

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:systfull}
L\zeta\mathbf{ v_i} +\mathbf{F^{\xi}_i(v_i)}= \mathbf{F^{\mu}_i(x_i)}+\mathbf{F^{\upsilon}_i(x_i)} + \sigma\mathbf{\hat{u}(x_i)}
\end{equation}

subject to constraints such that $\mathbf{v_i(x)}$ is 0 with $x=0$.  This results in an implicit differential equation for filament segments which can be discretized and integrated in time to produce a solution for the motion of the system.


\subsection*{Modeling filament turnover}

In living cells, actin filament assembly is governed by multiple factors that control nucleation, elongation and filament branching. Likewise filament disassembly is governed by multiple factors that promote filament severing and monomer dissociation at filament ends. Here, we focus on a lowest order model for filament recycling in which entire filaments appear with a fixed rate per unit area, $k_{app}$ and disappear at a rate $k_{diss}\rho$, where $\rho$ is a filament density. With this assumption, in the absence of network deformation, the density of filaments will equilibrate to a steady state density, $k_{app}/k_{diss}$, with time constant $\tau_r = 1/k_{diss}$.   In deforming networks, the density will be set by a competition between strain thinning or thickening, and density equilibration via turnover. To implement this assumption, at fixed time interval $\tau_s < 0.01\cdot\tau_r$ (i.e. 1\% of the equilibration time), we selected a fraction, $\tau_s/\tau_r$, of existing filaments (i.e. less than 1\% of the total filaments) for degradation. We then generated an a fixed number of new unstrained filaments $k_{app}\tau_sD_xD_y$ at random positions and orientations within the original domain.   We refer to this continuous turnover as ?filament recycling?, to $r_{diss}$ as the recycling rate, and to $\tau_r$ as the recycling time.


\subsection*{Simulation methods}

Details of our simulation approach can be found in the Appendix. Briefly, equations \ref{eqn:spring},\ref{eqn:drag},\ref{eqn:moto} and \ref{eqn:systfull} define a coupled system of ordinary differential equations for the velocities of the endpoints of filament segments, $\mathbf{x}$.  These equations are coupled by the effective cross-link friction on segment overlap points, yielding a system of the form:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A \cdot \dot x} = \mathbf{f(x)}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{A }$ represents a coupling matrix between endpoints of filaments that overlap, and $\mathbf{f(x)}$ is the spring force between pairs of filament segment endpoints.   We numerically integrated this system of equations to find the time evolution of the positions of all filament endpoints. We generate a network of filaments with random positions and orientations as described above within a domain of size $D_x$ by $D_y$.  For all simulations, we imposed periodic boundaries in the y-dimension. To impose an extensional stress, we constrained all filament segment endpoints within a fixed distance $0.05\cdot D_x$ from the left edge of the domain to be non-moving, then we imposed a rightwards force on all segment endpoints within a distance $0.05\cdot D_x$ from the left edge of the patch.   To simulation free contraction, we removed all constraints at boundaries; to assess buildup of contractile stress under isometricc conditions, we pinned both left and right edges of the network as described above.




We smoothed all filament interactions, force fields, and constraints over small regions such that the equations contained no sharp discontinuities. The nominal units for length, force, and time are $\mu m$, nN, and s, respectively.  We explored parameter space around an estimate of biologically relevant parameter values given in Table \ref{table:para}.

\section*{Results and Discussion}
The goal of this work was to characterize how rates and patterns of cortical flow are shaped by complex dependencies of active force generation and passive force dissipation on network architecture, local coupling (active and passive) between filaments and filament recycling.  We approached this in three steps: First, we analyzed the passive deformations of cross-linked networks (absent active motors) in response to a constant external force. Then, we analyzed the dynamics of internal stress buildup and dissipation in the same networks, but with active motors, as they contract freely or build force against fixed external boundaries. Finally, we consider the dynamic interplay of internal stress buildup, contraction, and stress relaxation in networks that undergo steady state flow in response to spatial gradients of motor activity.

% Example of passive simulation measurements
\paragraph{Networks with passive cross-links and no filament turnover undergo three stages of deformation in response to an extensional force.} 

To characterize the passive response of a cross-linked filament network in the absence of filament recycling and motor activity, we imposed an external force on the simulated network, and then quantified the mechanical response in terms of internal network stress and network strain as a function of time. Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}a shows the typical response of a simulated network. We measured the local velocity of the network at different positions along the axis of deformation as the mean velocity of all filament segments intersecting that position; we measured the internal network stress at each position by summing the axial component of the tensions on all filament segments intersecting that position, and dividing by network height; finally, we measured network strain rate as the average change in filament position divided by its original position.

During early (not shown) and intermediate (Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}b) stages of the deformation, the internal stress (blue) was nearly constant throughout the material while the velocity (orange) increased linearly with distance from the site network attachment, indicating an approximately uniform deformation (strain) rate throughout the material. Accordingly, we report the network response in terms of time-dependent bulk material stress and strain rates.

Plotting the bulk stress and strain as a function of time revealed that the deformation occurred in three qualitatively distinct phases (Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}a,c). On short timescales the response was viscoelastic, with a rapid buildup of internal stress and a rapid $\sim$exponential approach to a fixed strain, which represents the elastic limit in the absence of cross-link slip predicted by \cite{theo_hlm}. On intermediate timescales, the internal stress remained constant while the network continued to deform slowly and continuously with nearly constant strain rate (shown as dashed line in Fig \ref{fig:passive_ex}c) as filaments slipped past one another against the effective cross-link drag. This linear relationship between strain and time characterizes a material with an effective viscosity, $\eta_c$, given by the ratio of the applied stress to the strain rate. We define the transition time between the fast, viscoelastic phase and the slower, effectively viscous deformation phase as $\tau_c$. Finally, as the network strain approached a critical value ($\sim 30\%$ for the simulation in Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}), strain thinning led to decreased network connectivity, local tearing, and acceleration of the network deformation (see inset in Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}c), eventually resulting in the highly heterogeneous network structure shown in the t=440s example of Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}a.

% Viscosity and timescale parameter dependence
\paragraph{Network architecture sets the rate and timescales of deformation.}  To better understand how network architecture and cross-link dynamics control effective viscosity and the timescale for transition to viscous behavior, we systematically varied network parameters (see Table \nameref{S1_Table}), and measured the elastic modulus, $G_0$, effective viscosity, $\eta_c$, and transition time, $\tau_c$, in response to a fixed external stress. We observed the transition from a viscoelastic to an effectively viscous phase for the entire range of parameters that we sampled.  The elastic limit that we observe during the viscoelastic phase agreed closely with the closed form solution for the elastic modulus  $G_0 \sim \mu/l_c$ predicted by a previous model \cite{theo_hlm} for networks of semi-flexible filaments with irreversible cross-links (\nameref{fig:passive_supp}). A simple theoretical analysis (shown in \nameref{S1_Text}) predicts that in the effectively viscous phase, the effective viscosity should be proportional to the effective cross-link drag coefficient and to the square of the number of cross-links per filament, with a constant of proportionality $\pi/4$. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:passive_form}a, our simulations agree well with this prediction for a large range of network parameters. For many linear viscoelastic materials, the ratio of the elastic modulus, $G_0$, to the viscosity $\eta_c$, is a general indicator of the transition timescale from elastic to viscous behavior\cite{mccrum1997principles}. Using our approximations of the elastic modulus and viscosity, we predict a crossover time, $\tau_c \approx L^2\xi/l_c\mu$. By measuring the time at which the strain rate became nearly constant we obtained an estimate of this time for a wide variety of simulation parameters. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:passive_form}b, our approximation is in good agreement with the observed transition time, indicating that our simulations are well represented by effectively linear bulk properties. .

\end{figure}

To explore how filament recycling shapes the passive network response to an applied force, we ran a series of simulations with identical filament lengths and network densities and cross-link drag coefficients, while varying the filament recycling rate $r_{diss}$. Figure \ref{fig:passive_rec}a illustrates the results for a particular set of network parameters. In the absence of filament recycling, strain thinning and network tearing lead to a rapid increase in strain rate above a critical strain of $\sim40\%$. 

Progressively decreasing the filament recycling time led to a progressive increase in the rate of network deformation during the effectively viscous phase and an increase in the critical strain at which the network began to tear. Below a critical recycling time ($\tau_{crit}$), the network could sustain effectively viscous deformation indefinitely, as shown by the lack of strain thinning in the strain profiles of Figure\ref{fig:passive_rec}b. Intuitively, steady state deformation is achieved when the rate of filament depletion by strain thinning is balanced by a sufficiently high rate of filament recycling (i.e. a sufficiently low recycling time).  To determine the critical recycling time, we write an equation for the rate of change in filament density $\rho$, as a function of filament recycling ($k_{app}-k_{diss}\rho$) and strain thinning ($-\dot{\gamma}\rho$).These terms can be rewritten to give the following 

\begin{equation}
\frac{d \rho}{dt} = \frac{\rho_0-\rho}{\tau_r}  - \frac{\sigma}{\xi \eta_c(\rho)} \rho
\end{equation}

where $k_{diss}$  has been replaced by $1/\tau_r$, and $\rho_0 = k_{app}\tau_r$.  For our networks, the effective viscosity, $\eta_c$, is dependent on the filament density (through $l_c$) so this dependence must be included. Solving this equation for its steady states, and replacing the initial density, $\rho_0$, with the length density approximation, $1/l_c$, we find that a steady state density only exists under the condition $\tau_r < \tau_{crit}=\eta_c/4\sigma$.  

Reducing recycling time, $\tau_r$, below $\tau_{crit}$ produced different effects on steady state deformation rates depending on the relative values of $\tau_r$ and $\tau_c$, the characteristic time for transition to effectively viscous deformation in the absence of recycling. For $\tau_r > \tau_c$, the effective viscosity remained $\sim$constant with decreasing $\tau_r$; for $\tau_r < \tau_c$, effective viscosity decreased linearly with decreasing $\tau_r$.  The intuitive explanation for this is as follows: For $\tau_r > \tau_c$, the deformation rate is dominated by cross-link resistance to sliding of strained filaments. For $\tau_r < \tau_c$, the deformation rate is limited by the level of elastic stress on partially strained filaments; By replacing partially strained with unstrained filaments, the network is able to tune the mean level of stress and thus the deformation rate.


To confirm this relationship more generally, we measured the network deformation rates while varying filament recycling times (Figure \ref{fig:passive_rec}a,b). Indeed, by plotting plotted the normalized effective viscosity (ratio of effective viscosity with recycling to effective viscosity without recycling, $\eta_c$) vs a normalized recycling rate (recycling time scaled by $\tau_c$), revealed that the normalized effective viscosity measured during steady state flow begins to decrease when the recycling time falls below $\tau_c$ and below this value the effective viscosity falls off linearly with recycling time to minimal values (Figure \ref{fig:passive_rec}c). 

To describe this we introduce (based on linear viscoelastic models of \cite{mccrum1997principles}) an effective recycling viscosity, $\eta_r$, which can be tuned between the $\tau_r$ dependent and independent regimes, depending on the value of the recycling timescale.



\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\eta_r} = \frac{1}{\eta_c}  + \frac{1}{G_0\tau_c}e^{-\tau_r/\tau_c}
\end{equation}

In long $\tau_r\gg\tau_c$ limit, this simplifies to $\eta_r=\eta_c$, while in the short $\tau_r\ll\tau_c$ limit, this simplifies to $\eta_r\sim\tau_r$, which matches qualitatively with our estimate as found in Figure \ref{fig:passive_rec}d for a large range of parameters.  This model presents a simple quantitative description of our simulation data.



%Discuss
In summary, we find that tuning recycling rates above a critical value allows networks to undergo continuous viscous deformation, for long times, without tearing, for a wide range of different effective viscosities and deformation rates. Above this critical value, modulating filament recycling rates can tune the network between two regimes. At intermediate recycling timescales, the deformation is limited by effective cross-link friction, the effective viscosity depends on the strength of inter-filament cross-linking and the network's architecture, and is relatively insensitive to changes in recycling rate. For recycling times below $\tau_c$, the deformation is governed by the buildup of elastic stress on network filaments, and effective viscosity becomes strongly dependent on recycling time. 

These findings are in agreement with previous simulations on effective viscosity in cross-linked networks. A previous analysis \cite{Kim2014526} looked at the effect of a different form of filament turnover in networks with irreversible cross-linking. The authors also showed two regimes of deformation: one in which network deformation was linearly viscous and tuned by the turnover rate, and one where the creep rate was set purely by the turnover rate independent of applied force.  Although the implementation is different, the two regimes observed in our model are in qualitative agreement and arise from similar microscopic origins. Specifically, the short recycling time regime, where the mechanics are governed by filament extension, is directly equivalent in both models.  For this regime, our model is able to give a theoretical description of the effective viscosity found in \cite{Kim2014526}.  For the opposite regime of long recycling times, the models have a distinct difference.  For the model of \cite{Kim2014526} there was no cross-link unbinding so without of filament turnover, the network would not deform beyond its elastic limit.  In contrast, our simulations always require non-zero cross-link slip so there is always some viscous network deformation.  Therefore, in the regime of long recycling times our model approaches the limit of cross-link dominated viscosity whereas the model of \cite{Kim2014526} approached an infinite viscosity limit.

Total network strain also increases with the applied myosin force $\upsilon$. Note that the extent of contraction approaches an asymptotic limit as the stiffness asymmetry approaches a ratio of $\sim 100$.}
\end{figure}

Previous theoretical and experimental studies\cite{1367-2630-14-3-033037,rheo_2D1,rheo_active} identified asymmetric filament compliance and dispersion in motor force  as minimal requirements for contraction of disordered networks.To test if our simple implementation of these two requirements (see above) was sufficient to produce macroscopic contraction, we simulated active networks that were unconstrained by external attachments.  Turning on motor activity in an initially unstrained network at $t=0$ produced a rapid initial contraction, followed by a progressive buildup of elastic stress due to compression of individual filaments and an $\sim$exponential approach to stall. On a longer timescale, polarity sorting of individual filaments, as previously described \cite{Ndlec:1997aa,Surrey1167} rearranged the entire network, undoing the initial contraction (see \nameref{active_con_video}).  We focus here on the contraction phase.


 During the rapid initial contraction, bulk network strain matched closely the mean compressive strain on individual filaments  Figure \ref{fig:active_con}b,  Thus, as observed experimentally by \cite{rheo_2D1}, confirming that the origin of bulk contraction in our simulations is filament ?buckling? due to asymmetric filament compliance, as predicted experimentally (LENZ) and observed experimentally (MURRELL).  Contraction only occurred when the fractional motor activity $0<\phi<1$ (i.e. the fraction of filament intersections with active motors) was less than one, confirming the requirement for dispersion of motor activity (see \nameref{fig:active_supp})Thus our model effectively captures a minimal mechanism for bulk contractility in disordered networks through asymmetric filament compliance and dispersion of motor activityWe also explored how microscale network parameters shape the rate and final extent of contraction.  As stated above, contraction stalls when the elastic resistance to filament compression balances the contractile stress.  As expected, the final extent of contraction increased sharply with motor activity ($\upsilon$) and with the filament stiffness asymmetry (i.e. the ratio of the extensional and compressive stiffnesses $\mu_e/\mu_c$, Figure \ref{fig:active_con}c, Note that the extent of contraction approaches an asymptotic limit as the stiffness asymmetry approaches a ratio of $\sim 100$. . The time for the contraction to stall, $\tau_m=$, scaled as (show equation here) (see \nameref{fig:active_supp}), although the origins of this scaling relationship remain unclear.  These results define the internal limits on the rate and extent of network contraction in the absence of recycling.

\end{figure}

Cortical flows are governed by spatial gradients of motor activity; during flow,  contraction in regions with high motor activitywill be limited, not just by internal constraints on the contracting network, but also by the passive resistance of neighboring regions with low motor activity. To explore the consequences of this resistance, we analysed the buildup of contractile stress in active networks contracting against a rigid boundary. Figure \ref{fig:active_str}a shows the simulation of an active network contracting from an initially unstressed state against a fixed boundary,and \ref{fig:active_str}b plots the time evolution of mean extensional (blue), compressional (red) and total (black) stress on network filaments.  We observed the same qualitative behavior for all network parameters examined: A rapid initial buildup of extensional stress was followed by a slower dissipation of extensional stress and a comparably slow buildup of compressional stress.  The total stress exerted by the network on its boundary built rapidly with the extensional stress to a maximum value  $\sigma_a$, and then decayed to 0 as the slower buildup (resp. decay) of compressive (resp. extensional) stress brought internal compressive and extensional stress into balance. 

Finally, we measured the time of peak stress and found it consistently occurred with a characteristic time, $\tau_a=\xi/l_c\sqrt{\mu\upsilon}$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:active_str}c. 
{\em Need to say something here about the slower timescale of stress dissipation.  I understand that you have not yet found a scaling relationship for this one.  But it would be very nice, even if you can?t find such a relationship, to have a comparison between  the timescale to reach stall for the freely contracting network and the time to dissipate contractile stress in the pinned case. I.e. is one always bigger than the other for a particular choice of parameters? }

These results suggest that, in the absence of filament turnover, there are fundamental limits on the ability of a network to exert sustained force on its boundaries.  Over time, local filament deformation and rearrangement leads to a gradual buildup of internal compression and a dissipation of the extensional stress that is transmitted through the networks to its boundaries.


\paragraph{Filament recycling allows networks to exert sustained stress on a fixed boundary.}

\end{figure}

To explore how these limitations could be relieved by filament recycling.  We considered an active network contracting against a fixed boundary, using the same parameters as in Figure \ref{fig:active_str}, and systematically varied filament recycling rates.   Adding filament recycling produced two general effects:  First, as for the passive case, filament recycling could prevent catastrophic tearing by continuously repairing local structural heterogeneities, and by steadily opposing the effects of local strain thinning.  Second,   we found that filament recycling resulted in biphasic modulation of the level of steady state stress. Figure \ref{fig:active_rec}b. 

For the same network parameters as in Figure \ref{fig:active_rec}a and slow recycling rates ($\tau_r = 333$), the network stress peaked rapidly, but then relaxed to a nonzero net stress that persisted for times much longer than $\tau_a$. Decreasing recycling time to 33 produced an additional increase in the steady state stress. However, further decreases in recycling time lead to decreases in the steady state stress as well as sharp decreases in the peak stress.  Intuitively, this bimodal dependence of steady state stress on recycling rates emerges from continuous replacement of strained with unstrained filaments, combined with the different timescales for buildup of extensional vs compressive filament stress Figure \ref{fig:active_rec}b.  Because extensional stress builds more rapidly than extensional stress,  lowering the recycling time $\tau_c$ should increase imbalance of extensional over compressive stress until $\tau_c$ is approximately equal to $\tau_a$, the time required to build peak stress from an initially unstressed state.  For shorter recycling times,  the average filament will not have time to build maximum extensional stress before turning over,  and thus the steady state stress should decrease with further decreases in $\tau_c$.  Plotting normalized steady state stress (steady state stress/peak stress) vs normalized recycling time ($\tau_c$ /$\tau_a$) confirms that this biphasic dependence of steady state stress on recycling times holds for a large range of sampled values for network parameters \ref{fig:active_rec}d.













% COMBINED SECTION
\subsection*{Filament recycling tunes the balance between active stress buildup and viscous stress relaxation to generate flows}
We have shown that filament recycling has a strong impact on both passive and active properties of networks.  We ultimately wish to show how filament recycling impacts flows.  Active fluid theories propose that flow can be explained in terms of the interplay between active stress and effective viscosity. Therefore, we next tested whether we could measure the effect of recycling on flow in networks with both an active and a passive domain.
 

\paragraph{Filament recycling tunes the magnitudes of both effective viscosity and steady state stress.}  
To begin, we repeated the single domain (passive or active) simulations while varying all of our networks microscopic parameters.   By exploring the effect of these parameters on the output variables we were able to determine the general form of the dependence. In Figure \ref{fig:passive_rec}d, we illustrate the data collapse of all our simulation results (see \nameref{S1_Table} for details of parameter exploration).  Interestingly, both the viscosity (in Figure \ref{fig:passive_rec}d) and stress (in Figure \ref{fig:active_rec}d) show changes in behaviors on either side of their respective governing timescales ($\tau_c$ for viscosity and $\tau_a$ for active stress).  Effective viscosity was found to be independent of recycling time until recycling time became of the same order as the elastic to viscous crossover timescale, at which point it decreased with decreasing recycling time.  Similarly, the steady state stress increases with increasing recycling time until it reaches the point of peak stress buildup.  From that point it decreases with increasing recycling time.





\paragraph{Filament recycling allows sustained flows in networks with non-isotropic activity.}

\begin{figure}[h!]

	\includegraphics[width=\hsize]{figures/figure6a}
	\caption{\label{fig:flow_ex}  Filament recycling allows sustained flows in networks with non-isotropic activity. \textbf{a)} Example simulations of non-isotropic networks with long ($\tau_r=1000$) and short ($\tau_r=33$) recycling timescales.

Network parameters are same as in Figures \ref{fig:active_str} and \ref{fig:active_rec}. \textbf{b)} Graph of strain for identical networks varying recycling timescales.

Note that networks only begin to maintain long-term flows when the recycling time is less than $100\tau_a$. }
\end{figure}

To clearly interrogate the mutual dependencies of effective viscosity and active stress, we next combined passive and active elements in the same simulations.  As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:flow_ex}a, we generated networks where the left side of the domain contained only passive cross-linkers, while the right side contained a mix of active and passive cross-links.  In these networks, we observed a sharp dependence of flow behavior on filament recycling rate.  In the $\tau_r=1000 s$ case, filaments deformed more extensively (orange lines), and the network developed noticeable spatial heterogeneity.  On the other hand for shorter recycling time of $\tau_r=33$ s, the network remained much more connected and filaments underwent less total compressional strain.  We measured the flow profile across the entire simulation and observed that in both cases the flow field converged on the region at the midline (see \nameref{fig:combo_prof}) in a manner highly similar to physiological flow profiles found in e.g. \textit{C. elegans} embryos.  However, there were large differences in the magnitude and duration of the resulting flows which depended on the recycling time.

To understand the time progression of the flow profile, we measured the average network strain over time.  From this measurement, we could see a sharp dependence of the behavior on the recycling time, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:flow_ex}b.  For very long recycling times ($\tau_r=1000$, dark blue line), the network showed a rapid initial deformation that quickly reached its limit and stalled.  However, with decreasing filament recycling times, we found the network was able to sustain its deformation and that the long term strain rate rose toward an asymptotic limit (Figure \ref{fig:flow_ex}c).  We repeated these measurements for more network parameters and found that at the shortest recycling timescales measured, we still saw the effective viscosity remaining relatively high, indicating that for sufficiently short recycling times the effective viscosity may approach an asymptotic flow rate (Figure \ref{fig:flow_ex}d).



\paragraph{Filament recycling influences architectural control of flow rate.}

\begin{figure}[h!]

	\includegraphics[width=\hsize]{figures/figure6b}
	\caption{\label{fig:flow_form}  Filament recycling influences architectural control of flow rate. \textbf{a)}  For a fixed filament recoiling time, filament length tuned network deformation rate.  \textbf{b)} Recycling rate is independent of cross-link spacing in this parameter space.}
\end{figure}

As a final point, we wished to mention what happens when filament recycling is held constant and other parameters are changed.  Interestingly, we found surprising architectural dependence for network architectures very closely poised to our physiological estimates.  In that regime, filament length was able to tune networks between a low flow and a high flow mode with close to $1/L$ dependence.  We believe this may be due to the difference in $L$ dependence between the timescales of effective viscosity and stress buildup. 









%Conclusion
\section*{Conclusion}
Our work aimed to create a simulation framework that would allow us to analyze the origins of macroscopic flow in terms of a handful of physiologically relevant microscopic parameters.  Toward this aim we developed a minimalist model of a 2D filament network and analyzed the network's reaction to a variety of situations.  We found mathematical relationships that determined both the passive effective viscosity and the active stress generation of networks with and without recycling.  From these relationships we were able to make predictions about the .  

Importantly, our work brings a theoretical understanding to the importance of actomyosin turnover in producing and maintaining long-term large scale flows.  This is not entirely surprising due to the abundance of physiological mechanisms for generating network turnover.  We propose the concept of "filament recycling" to refer to the multitude of biochemical interactions which can give rise to the piece by piece architectural resetting of filament networks.  We believe that our analysis of networks in the presence of this filament recycling will be useful in further developing the qualitative and quantitative understanding the deformation of these complex networks.
