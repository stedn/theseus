\section*{Abstract}
An animal cell's ability to move and change shape depends on the actomyosin cortex, a thin layer of cross-linked actin filaments and myosin motors that lies just beneath the plasma membrane.  The actomyosin cortex is highly dynamic; filaments are disassembled and reassembled continuously, with a typical monomer lifetime of just tens of seconds.  Dynamic filament recycling is essential to allow remodeling of cellular structure during development, but how this works remains poorly understood.  To explore the interplay of actomyosin mechanics and filament turnover, we developed a coarse-grained computational model of a 2D active network.  Our model accounts for (1) asymmetric filament compliance, (2) motor driven filament movement, (3) coupling of filaments through cross-link interaction, and (4) recycling of individual filaments.  This minimal model recapitulates cellular processes and provides insight into the microscopic control parameters governing cortical flow.  In particular, the model makes predictions about the way filament recycling affects (1) the passive effective viscosity of a cross-linked network, (2) the rates and magnitudes of deformation and stress buildup in active networks, and (3) the rates of flow in non-isotropic networks.  These results agree well with biologically relevant systems such as the developing \textit{C. elegans} embryo.

\section*{Author Summary}
In this paper, we develop and analyze a minimal model for 2D active networks based on the cortical cytoskeleton of eukaryotic embryos.  Our model introduces a series of coarse-grained approximations for simultaneous comparison of cross-link stress dissipation, myosin driven active stress generation and a form of rapid filament turnover we term {\em filament recycling}.  We generate computational simulations based on the model and demonstrate that our minimal assumptions are sufficient to drive network contraction and to set up steady state flow profiles such as those found in the cortex of developing embryos and migrating cells.  Our analysis sheds insight on potential microscopic control parameters governing broad qualitative differences in 2D active networks.

\section*{Introduction}

\paragraph{}  Cortical flow is a fundamental and ubiquitous form of cellular deformation that underlies cell polarization, cell division, cell crawling and multicellular tissue morphogenesis\cite{cellmech_flows3,cellmech_flows2}.  These flows arise within the actomyosin cortex, a thin layer of cross-linked actin filaments and myosin motors that lies just beneath the plasma membrane \cite{Salbreux2012536}. The active forces that drive cortical flows are thought to be generated by myosin motors pulling against individual actin filaments \cite{Munro2004413}. These forces must be integrated within cross-linked networks to build macroscopic contractile stress.  At the same time, cross-linked networks resist deformation and this resistance must be dissipated by network remodeling to allow macroscopic network deformation and flow.  How force production and dissipation depend on motor activity, network architecture and remodeling remains poorly understood.

Current models for cortical flow rely on coarse-grained descriptions of actomyosin networks as active fluids, whose motions are driven by gradients of active contractile stress and opposed by an effectively viscous resistance\cite{cellmech_flows}.  In these models, gradients of active stress are assumed to reflect spatial variation in motor activity and viscous resistance is assumed to reflect the internal dissipation of elastic resistance due to local remodeling of filaments and/or cross-links \cite{PhysRevLett.106.028103}.  A key virtue of these models is that their behavior is governed by a few parameters (active stress and effective viscosity).  By coupling an active fluid description to simple kinetic models for network assembly and disassembly and making active stress and effective viscosity depend on e.g network density and turnover rates, it is possible to capture phenomenological descriptions of cortical flow.  Models based on this active fluids description can successfully reproduce spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical flow observed during polarization \cite{cellmech_flows}, cell division \cite{Turlier2014114,PhysRevLett.103.058102}, cell motility \cite{Keren:2009aa,RevModPhys.85.1143} and tissue morphogenesis \cite{Heisenberg2013948}.  

However, to understand how cells exert physiological control over cortical deformation and flow, or to build and tune networks with desired properties {\em in vitro}, it is essential to connect this coarse-grained description to the microscopic origins of force generation and dissipation within cross-linked actomyosin networks.  Both active stress and effective viscosity depend sensitively on microscopic parameters including densities of filaments, motors and cross-links, force-dependent motor/filament interactions, cross-link dynamics and network turnover rates.  Thus a key challenge is to understand how tuning these microscopic parameters controls the dynamic interplay between active force generation and passive relaxation to control macroscopic dynamics of cortical flow.

\paragraph{} Studies in living cells have documented fluid-like stress relaxation on timescales of 10-100s of seconds \cite{cellmech_flows,cellmech_flows2,cellmech_flows3,rheo_fluid,rheo_fluid2,cell_rheo_exp}.  These modes of stress relaxation are thought to arise both from the transient binding/unbinding of individual cross-links and from the turnover (assembly/disassembly) of actin filaments (ref).  Studies of cross-linked and/or bundled actin networks {\em in vitro} suggest that cross-link unbinding may be sufficient to support viscous relaxation (creep) on very long timescales\cite{rheo_crosslinksmatter,rheo_crosslinkslip1,rheo_crosslinkslip2,rheo_crosslinkslip3,rheo_nonaffine}, but is unlikely to explain the rapid large scale cortical deformation and flow observed in living cells.  It has been proposed in the field that rapid actin turnover must play a significant role as well. Indeed, photokinetic and single molecule imaging studies studies reveal rapid turnover of cortical actin filaments in living cells on timescales of 10-100 seconds \cite{Robin:2014aa}. Previous theoretical models have explored  the dependence of stress relaxation on cross-link binding and unbinding analytically \cite{theo_crosslinkslip1,theo_crosslinkslip2} and others have explicitly modeled reversible cross-linking in combination with complex mechanics of filament bundles \cite{model_taeyoon,rheo_crosslinkslip2,theo_crosslinkslip3}, leading to complex viscoelastic stress relaxation.  However, until very recently \cite{Mak:2016aa} very little attention has been paid to actin turnover as mechanism of stress relaxation. 

Recent work has also begun to reveal insights into mechanisms that govern active stress generation in disordered actomyosin networks. In vitro studies have confirmed that local interactions among actin filaments and myosin motors are sufficient to drive macroscopic contraction of disordered networks \cite{rheo_2D1}.  Theoretical studies suggest that asymmetrical compliance of actin filaments (stiffer under extension than compression) and spatial differences (dispersion) in motor activity are sufficient conditions for contraction in one \cite{1367-2630-14-3-033037} and two \cite{PhysRevX.4.041002} dimensional networks, although other routes to contractility may also exist \cite{PhysRevX.4.041002}.  Further work has explored how modulation of network architecture, cross-link dynamics and motor density, activity and assembly state can shape rates and patterns of network deformation \cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0039869,Alvarado:2013aa,C0SM00494D} or network rheology \cite{0295-5075-85-1-18007,rheo_active}.  

Significantly, {\em in vitro} models for disordered actomyosin networks have used stable actin filaments, and these networks support only transient contraction, either because of network collapse\cite{Alvarado:2013aa}, or buildup of elastic resistance\cite{Murrell15062014}, or because network rearrangements (polarity sorting) dissipate the potential to generate contractile force \cite{Ndlec:1997aa,Surrey1167}. This suggests that continuous turnover of actin filaments may play a key role in allowing sustained deformation and flow. Recent theoretical and modeling studies have begun to explore how this could work \cite{2015arXiv150706182H,Mak:2016aa,10.1371/journal.pone.0000696}, and to explore dynamic behaviors that can emerge in contractile material with turnover \cite{PhysRevLett.113.148102}. However, there is much to learn about how the buildup and maintenance of contractile force during continuous deformation and flow depends on the local interplay of network architecture, motor activity and filament turnover.



\paragraph{}  The goal of this work is to build a computational bridge between the microscopic description of cross-linked actomyosin networks and the coarse grained macroscopic description of an active fluid.  We seek to capture the essential microscope features (dynamic cross-links, active motors and semi flexible actin filaments with asymmetric compliance and continuous filament recycling), but in a way that is sufficiently simple to allow systematic exploration of how parameters that govern network deformation and flow in an active fluid theory depend on microscopic parameters. To this end, we introduce several coarse-grained approximations into our representation of filament networks. First, we represent semi-flexible actin filaments as simple springs with asymmetric compliance (stronger in extension than compression). Second, we replace  dynamic binding/unbinding of elastic cross-links with a coarse-grained representation in terms of molecular friction \cite{theo_friction,theo_frictionSam,theo_molefric}, such that filaments can slide past each other against a constant frictional resistance. Third, we used a similar scheme to introduce active motors at filament crossover points with a simple linear force/velocity relationship, and we introduce dispersion of motor activity by making only a subset of filament overlaps active \cite{theo_frictionShila}.  Finally, we model filament turnover by allowing entire filaments to appear and disappear with a fixed probabilities per unit time. Importantly, these simplifications allow us to extend our single polymer models to dynamical systems of larger network models for direct comparison between theory and modeling results. This level of coarse graining will therefore make it easier to understand classes of behavior for varying compositions of cross-linked filament networks. In addition, it allows us to compute a new class of numerical simulations efficiently, which gives us concrete predictions for behaviors in widely different networks with measurable dependencies on molecular details.

Our motivation is to model essential microscope features of cross-linked actomyosin networks (semi flexible actin filaments with asymmetric compliance, dynamic cross-links, active motors and and continuous filament recycling), in a way that is simple enough to allow systematic exploration of how tuning these microscopic features controls macroscopic network deformation and flow. We focus on 2D networks for computational tractability and because they capture a reasonable approximation of the quasi-2D cortical actomyosin networks that govern flow and deformation in many eukaryotic cells\cite{cellmech_flows, salbreuxbphs}, or the quasi-2D networks studied recently in vitro\cite{rheo_2D1,rheo_2D2}.


\subsection*{Asymmetric filament compliance}
We model individual filaments as chains of springs with relaxed length $l_s$.  Filaments can therefore be represented as a sequence of nodes with positions $\mathbf{x_i}$, where the index $i$ enumerates over all nodes of all segments.  The internal elastic resistance of filament segments gives rise to nearest neighbor force interactions, $\mathbf{F^{\mu}_{i,i+1}}$, of the form

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:spring}
\mathbf{F^{\mu}_{i,i+1}} = \mu\frac{|\mathbf{x_{i+1}}-\mathbf{x_i}|-l_s}{l_s}\left ( \frac{\mathbf{x_{i+1}}-\mathbf{x_i}}{l_s}\right )
\end{equation}


where the modulus, $\mu$, is a composite quantity representing both filament and cross-linker compliance in a manner similar to a proposed effective medium theory \cite{theo_crosslinknonlinear}. To model asymmetric filament compliance, we assign a different value to the modulus $\mu$,  depending on whether the strain on a given filament segment, $(|\mathbf{x_{i-1}}-\mathbf{x_i}|-l_s)/l_s$, is greater or less than 0. In the limit of highly rigid cross-links and flexible filaments, our model reduces to the pure semi-flexible filament models of \cite{theo_hlm,theo_hlm2}. In the opposite regime of nearly rigid filaments and highly flexible cross links, our model is essentially the same as that of \cite{theo_crosslinknonlinear} in small strain regimes before any nonlinear cross link stiffening. In a departure from those previous models, we assume here that the magnitude of the force on interior cross-links is the same as those on the exterior. This approach ignores the variation in strain on these two sets of cross-links as addressed in \cite{theo_crosslinknonlinear}, but we choose to ignore this variation in favor of an approximated, global mean approach. 

Because we are dealing with semi-flexible filaments we also introduce a bending modulus between our filament segments such that the restoring force is proportional to the angle between the filament segments and points in the direction orthogonal to the filament direction, $\mathbf{u_i}=(\mathbf{x_{i-1}}-\mathbf{x_{i}})/|\mathbf{x_{i-1}}-\mathbf{x_{i}}|$.   


The total internal force on a filament node i can therefore be written as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:internal}
\mathbf{F^{int}_i} = \mathbf{F^{\mu}_{i-1,i}} + \mathbf{F^{\mu}_{i,i+1}} 
\end{equation}

Introducing a filament bending stiffness adds another mode of asymmetric compliance since filaments can bend/buckle internally under compression. For the majority of the work presented here, we have set $l_s=L$ to obviate dependence on bending driven asymmetries. However, the major points of the paper are still valid for $l_s<L$ under the condition that $\kappa/l_s\gg\mu_c$. 

\subsection*{Drag-like coupling between overlapping filaments}
\label{exp_drag}
Previous models represent cross-linkers as elastic connections between pairs of points on neighboring filaments that appear and disappear with either fixed or force-dependent probabilities \cite{model_taeyoon,theo_crosslinknonlinear}.  Here, we introduce a simpler coarse-grained model for dynamic cross-links by replacing many transient elastic interactions with an effective drag-like coupling between every pair of overlapping segments.
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:drag}
\mathbf{F^{\xi}_{i-1,i}} = \xi \sum_j \frac{l_s-|s_{ij}-s_i|}{l_s}  (\mathbf{v_{i-1,i}}-\mathbf{v_{j-1,j}}) 
\end{equation}

where $s_i$ is the location (in arc length) of node $i$, $\mathbf{v_{n-1,n}}$ represent the average velocity of the filament segment spanning nodes $n-1$ and $n$, and the sum is taken over all filament segments such that the segment from node $j-1$ to node $j$ intersects the segment from $i-1$ to $i$ at the location $s_{ij}$.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:drag}
\mathbf{F^{coup}_{i}} = \mathbf{F^{\xi}_{i-1,i}} + \mathbf{F^{\xi}_{i,i-1}} 
\end{equation}

This model assumes a linear relation between the drag force and the velocity difference between attached segments.  This drag-like coupling has been shown to be an adequate approximation in the case of ionic cross-linking of actin\cite{mol_fric,theo_hydroish2}, and can be found in the theoretical basis of force-velocity curves for myosin bound filaments\cite{theo_frictionShila}. Although non-linearities can arise through force dependent detachment kinetics and/or non-linear force extension of cross-links, we assume that inhomogeneities from non-linear effects are of second or higher order. With this assumption, the motion of filaments can be described by a deterministic dynamical equation of the form

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:syst1}
0 = -l_s\zeta\mathbf{ v_i} -\mathbf{F^{coup}_i}+ \mathbf{F^{int}_i}
\end{equation}

Here, the first term is the filament's intrinsic drag through its embedding fluid, $\zeta$, while the second comes from the drag-like coupling between filaments, $\xi$.  

\subsection*{Active coupling for motor driven filament interactions}

To add motor activity we select a subset of cross-linked points and impose an additional force of magnitude $\upsilon$ on each of the overlapping filament segments, directed towards the (+) end of that segment, $\mathbf{u_i}=(\mathbf{x_{i-1}}-\mathbf{x_{i}})/|\mathbf{x_{i-1}}-\mathbf{x_{i}}|$. Thus, the total ``active'' force on a given filament segment is

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:moto}
\mathbf{F^{\upsilon}_{i-1,i}}=\upsilon \mathbf{u_i}\sum_j \frac{l_s-|s_{ij}-s_i|}{l_s}q_{ij}
\end{equation}

where $q_{ij}$ equals 0 or 1 depending on whether there is an ``active'' cross-linker at this location. To model dispersion of motor activity, we set $q_{ij}=1$  on a randomly selected subset of cross-link points at the beginning of the simulation, such that $\bar{q}=\phi$, where $\bar{q}$ indicates the mean of $q$.  



Finally, for each active force, $\mathbf{F^{act}_j}$, imparted by filament $j$, we must also impart the opposite force onto the filament between $i$ and $i+1$ as well.  Therefore, the entire equation for activity will appear as

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:active}
\mathbf{F^{act}_{i}}=\mathbf{F^{\upsilon}_{i-1,i}} + \mathbf{F^{\upsilon}_{i,i+1}}
- \sum_{j}\mathbf{F^{\upsilon}_{j-1,j}}q_{ij}
\end{equation}


This will leave us with a full equation of motion given by the sum of each of the parts defined above.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:syst3}
0=-L\zeta\mathbf{ v_i} -\mathbf{F^{coup}_i}+ \mathbf{F^{int}_i}+\mathbf{F^{act}_i} 
\end{equation}

\subsection*{2D network formation}

We used a mikado model approach \cite{Unterberger2014} to initialize a minimal network of connected unstressed linear filaments in a rectangular 2D domain. We generate 2D networks of these semi-flexible filaments by laying down straight lines of length, L, with random position and orientation. We then assume that overlapping filaments become cross-linked at their points of overlap. Although real cytoskeletal networks may form with non-negligible anisotropy, for simplicity, we focus on isotropically initialized networks. We define the density using the average distance between cross-links along a filament, $l_c$. A simple geometrical argument can then be used to derive the number of filaments filling a domain as a function of $L$ and $l_c$\cite{theo_hlm}.  Here, we use the approximation that the number of filaments needed to tile a rectangular domain of size $D_x \times D_y$  is $2D_xD_y/Ll_c$, and that the length density is therefore simply, $2/l_c$. In the absence of cross-link slip, we expect the network to form a connected solid with a well defined elastic modulus\cite{theo_hlm,theo_hlm2}.


\subsection*{External applied stress}
We can model our active networks as a coupled system of differential equations satisfying \ref{eqn:syst3}.  However, to probe the passive response of the network, we also wish to incorporate externally applied stresses.  Although the general passive mechanical response of this system may be very complex, we focus our attention on low frequency deformations and the steady-state creep response of the system to an applied stress.  To do this we introduce a fixed stress, $\sigma$ along a fixed domain at one edge of the network.  The stress is applied via individual forces to the filaments lying within a patch of size $D_w$ such that the sum of individual forces is equal to the applied stress times the height of the domain.  These forces point in the direction, $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$, producing an extension of the patch.  The region of applied stress does not move as the network deforms, allowing us to more easily focus our attention on a fixed sized domain. 

Finally, we add a 0 velocity constraint at the other edge of our domain of interest.  We assume that our network is in the ``dry,'' low Reynold's number limit, where inertial effects are so small that we can equate our total force to 0.  Therefore, we have a dynamical system of wormlike chain filaments satisfying

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:systfull}
0=-L\zeta\mathbf{ v_i} -\mathbf{F^{coup}_i}+ \mathbf{F^{int}_i}+\mathbf{F^{act}_i} + \sigma\mathbf{\hat{u}(x_i)}
\end{equation}

subject to constraints such that $\mathbf{v_i(x)}$ is 0 with $x=0$.  This results in an implicit differential equation for filament segments which can be integrated in time to produce a solution for the motion of the system.


\subsection*{Modeling filament turnover}

In living cells, actin filament assembly is governed by multiple factors that control nucleation, elongation, and filament branching. Likewise filament disassembly is governed by multiple factors that promote filament severing and monomer dissociation at filament ends. Here, we focus on a lowest order model for filament recycling in which entire filaments appear with a fixed rate per unit area, $k_{app}$ and disappear at a rate $k_{diss}\rho$, where $\rho$ is a filament density. With this assumption, in the absence of network deformation, the density of filaments will equilibrate to a steady state density, $k_{app}/k_{diss}$, with time constant $\tau_r = 1/k_{diss}$.   In deforming networks, the density will be set by a competition between strain thinning ($\gamma>0$) or thickening ($\gamma<0$), and density equilibration via turnover. To implement this assumption, at fixed time interval $\tau_s < 0.01\cdot\tau_r$ (i.e. 1\% of the equilibration time), we selected a fraction, $\tau_s/\tau_r$, of existing filaments (i.e. less than 1\% of the total filaments) for degradation. We then generated a fixed number of new unstrained filaments $k_{app}\tau_sD_xD_y$ at random positions and orientations within the original domain.   This method ensures that there is a constant fixed number of filaments present throughout the simulation. We refer to this continuous turnover as filament recycling, to $k_{diss}=1/\tau_r$ as the recycling rate, and to $\tau_r$ as the recycling time.


\subsection*{Simulation methods}

Details of our simulation approach and references to our code can be found in the Appendix. Briefly, equations \ref{eqn:spring},\ref{eqn:drag},\ref{eqn:moto} and \ref{eqn:systfull} define a coupled system of ordinary differential equations for the velocities of the endpoints of filament segments, $\mathbf{\dot{x}}$.  These equations are coupled by the effective cross-link friction on segment overlap points, yielding a system of the form:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A \cdot \dot x} = \mathbf{f(x)}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{A }$ represents a coupling matrix between endpoints of filaments that overlap, and $\mathbf{f(x)}$ is the spring force between pairs of filament segment endpoints.   We numerically integrate this system of equations to find the time evolution of the positions of all filament endpoints. We generate a network of filaments with random positions and orientations as described above within a domain of size $D_x$ by $D_y$.  For all simulations, we imposed periodic boundaries in the y-dimension. When imposing an extensional stress, we constrained all filament segment endpoints within a fixed distance $0.05\cdot D_x$ from the left edge of the domain to be non-moving, then we imposed a rightwards force on all segment endpoints within a distance $0.05\cdot D_x$ from the left edge of the patch.   To simulate free contraction, we removed all constraints at boundaries; to assess buildup of contractile stress under isometric conditions, we used periodic boundary conditions in both $x$ and $y$ dimensions.




We smoothed all filament interactions, force fields, and constraints by allowing forces to decay linearly over small regions such that the equations contained no sharp discontinuities. The nominal units for length, force, and time are $\mu m$, nN, and s, respectively.  We explored parameter space around an estimate of biologically relevant parameter values given in Table \ref{table:para}.

\section*{Results and Discussion}
We aim to characterize how rates and patterns of cortical flow are shaped by complex dependencies of active stress generation and passive stress dissipation on network architecture, local coupling (active and passive) between filaments and filament recycling.  We approached this in three steps: First, we analyzed the passive deformations of cross-linked networks (absent active motors) in response to a constant external force. Then, we analyzed the dynamics of internal stress buildup and dissipation in the same networks, but with active motors, as they contract freely or build force against fixed external boundaries. Finally, we consider the dynamic interplay of internal stress buildup, contraction, and stress relaxation in networks that undergo steady state flow in response to spatial gradients of motor activity.

\subsection*{Filament recycling prevents cortical tearing and modulates the viscous stress relaxation of passive filament networks}
 
% Example of passive simulation measurements
\paragraph{Networks with passive cross-links and no filament turnover undergo three stages of deformation in response to an extensional force.} 

To characterize the passive response of a cross-linked filament network in the absence of filament recycling and motor activity, we imposed an external force on the simulated network, and then quantified the mechanical response in terms of internal network stress and network strain as a function of time. Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}a shows the typical response of a simulated network. We measured the local velocity of the network at different positions along the axis of deformation as the mean velocity of all filament segments intersecting that position; we measured the internal network stress at each position by summing the axial component of the tensions on all filament segments intersecting that position, and dividing by network height; finally, we measured network strain rate as the average of all filaments velocities divided by their positions.

During early (not shown) and intermediate (Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}b) stages of the deformation, the internal stress (blue) was nearly constant throughout the material while the velocity (orange) increased linearly with distance from the site of network attachment, indicating an approximately uniform deformation (strain) rate throughout the material. Accordingly, we report the network response in terms of time-dependent bulk material stress and strain.

Plotting the bulk stress and strain as a function of time revealed that the deformation occurred in three qualitatively distinct phases (Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}a,c). On short timescales the response was viscoelastic, with a rapid buildup of internal stress and a rapid $\sim$exponential approach to a fixed strain (Figure \nameref{fig:passive_supp}a), which represents the elastic limit in the absence of cross-link slip predicted by \cite{theo_hlm}. On intermediate timescales, the internal stress remained constant while the network continued to deform slowly and continuously with nearly constant strain rate (shown as dashed line in Fig \ref{fig:passive_ex}c) as filaments slipped past one another against the effective cross-link drag. This linear relationship between strain and time characterizes a material with an effective viscosity, $\eta$, given by the ratio of the applied stress to the strain rate. We define the transition time between the fast, viscoelastic phase and the slower, effectively viscous deformation phase as $\tau_c$. Finally, as the network strain approached a critical value ($\sim 30\%$ for the simulation in Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}), strain thinning led to decreased network connectivity, local tearing, and acceleration of the network deformation (see inset in Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}c), eventually resulting in the highly heterogeneous network structure shown in the t=440s example of Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}a.

% Viscosity and timescale parameter dependence
\paragraph{Network architecture sets the rate and timescales of deformation.}  To better understand how network architecture and cross-link dynamics control effective viscosity and the timescale for transition to viscous behavior, we systematically varied network parameters (see \nameref{S1_Table}), and measured the elastic modulus, $G_0$, effective viscosity, $\eta$, and transition time, $\tau_c$, in response to a fixed external stress. We observed the transition from a viscoelastic to an effectively viscous phase for the entire range of parameters that we sampled.  The elastic limit that we observe during the viscoelastic phase agreed closely with the closed form solution for the elastic modulus  $G_0 \sim \mu/l_c$ predicted by a previous model \cite{theo_hlm} for networks of semi-flexible filaments with irreversible cross-links (\nameref{fig:passive_supp}b). A simple theoretical analysis (shown in \nameref{S1_Text}) predicts that in the viscous phase, the effective viscosity should be proportional to the cross-link drag coefficient and to the square of the number of cross-links per filament, with a constant of proportionality $\pi/4$. We define this predicted scaling of effective viscosity as $\eta_c$.

\begin{equation}
\eta_c = \frac{\pi}{4}\xi\left ( \frac{L}{l_c}-1\right )^2
\end{equation}


As shown in Figure \ref{fig:passive_form}a, our simulations agree well with this prediction for a large range of network parameters. For many linear viscoelastic materials, the ratio of the viscosity, $\eta_c$, to the elastic modulus, $G_0$, is a general indicator of the transition timescale from elastic to viscous behavior\cite{mccrum1997principles}. Using our approximations of the elastic modulus and viscosity, we predict a crossover time, $\tau_c \approx L^2\xi/l_c\mu$. By measuring the time at which the strain rate became nearly constant (i.e. $\gamma \sim t^n$ with $n>0.8$), we obtained an estimate of this time for a wide variety of simulation parameters. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:passive_form}b, our approximation is in good agreement with the observed transition time, indicating that the passive responses of our simulated networks are well represented by effectively linear bulk properties, at least over small strains.

\end{figure}

To explore how filament recycling shapes the passive network response to an applied force, we ran a series of simulations with identical filament lengths and network densities and cross-link drag coefficients, while varying the filament recycling time $\tau_r=1/k_{diss}$. Figure \ref{fig:passive_rec}a illustrates the results for a particular set of network parameters. In the absence of filament recycling, strain thinning and network tearing lead to a rapid increase in strain rate above a strains of $\sim40\%$. 

Progressively decreasing the filament recycling time led to a progressive increase in the rate of network deformation during the effectively viscous phase and an increase in the critical strain at which the network began to tear. As we decreased the recycling time below a critical recycling time ($\tau_{crit}$), the networks began to sustain effectively viscous deformation indefinitely. Intuitively, steady state deformation is achieved when the rate of filament depletion by strain thinning is balanced by a sufficiently high rate of filament recycling (i.e. a sufficiently low recycling time).  To determine the critical recycling time, we write an equation for the rate of change in filament density $\rho$, as a function of filament recycling ($k_{app}-k_{diss}\rho$) and strain thinning ($-\dot{\gamma}\rho$).
These terms can be rewritten to give the following 

\begin{equation}
\frac{d \rho}{dt} = \frac{\rho_0-\rho}{\tau_r}  - \frac{\sigma}{\eta_c(\rho)} \rho
\end{equation}

where $k_{diss}$  has been replaced by $1/\tau_r$, and $\rho_0 = k_{app}\tau_r$, and $\dot{\gamma}$ has been replaced by $\sigma/\eta_c$.  For our networks, the effective viscosity, $\eta_c$, is dependent on the filament density (through $l_c$) so this dependence must be included. Solving this equation for its steady states, and replacing the initial density, $\rho_0$, with the length density approximation, $2/l_c$, we predict that a constant steady state density only exists under the condition $\tau_r < \tau_{crit}=\eta_c/2\sigma$.  

Reducing recycling time, $\tau_r$, below $\tau_{crit}$ produced different effects on steady state deformation rates depending on the relative values of $\tau_r$ and $\tau_c$, the transition to effectively viscous deformation in the absence of recycling.  For $\tau_r > \tau_c$, the deformation rate is dominated by cross-link resistance to sliding of strained filaments, and the effective viscosity remained $\sim$constant with decreasing $\tau_r$; for $\tau_r < \tau_c$, effective viscosity decreased sublinearly with decreasing $\tau_r$. Intuitively, this is because, for $\tau_r < \tau_c$, the deformation rate is limited by the level of elastic stress on partially strained filaments; By replacing partially strained with unstrained filaments, the network is able to tune the mean level of stress and thus the deformation rate.


To confirm this relationship more generally, we allowed filament lengths, network density and cross link friction to vary more widely, and we measured the network deformation rates while varying filament recycling times (Figure \ref{fig:passive_rec}a,b). We then plotted the normalized effective viscosity (ratio of effective viscosity with recycling to effective viscosity without recycling, $\eta_c$) vs a normalized recycling rate (recycling time scaled by $\tau_c$). Indeed, we found that the normalized effective viscosity measured during steady state flow begins to decrease when the recycling time falls below $\tau_c$ and below this value the effective viscosity falls off nearly linearly with recycling time to minimal values (Figure \ref{fig:passive_rec}c). 

To describe this we introduce (based on linear viscoelastic models of \cite{mccrum1997principles}) an effective recycling viscosity, $\eta_r$, which can be tuned between the $\tau_r$ dependent and independent regimes, depending on the value of the recycling timescale.



\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:simple_eta}
\eta_r = \frac{\eta_c}{1+(\tau_c/\tau_r)^m}  
\end{equation}

For $\tau_r\gg\tau_c$, this simplifies to $\eta_r\approx\eta_c$, while for $\tau_r\ll\tau_c$, this simplifies to $\eta_r\sim(\tau_r/\tau_c)^m$, which matches with our measurements as found in Figure \ref{fig:passive_rec}d for a large range of parameters (with $m=3/4$). While the origins of the $3/4$ scaling remain unclear, this model captures a simple quantitative description of our simulation data.



%Discuss
In summary, our simulations predict that tuning recycling times below a critical value $\tau_{crit}$, allows networks to undergo continuous viscous deformation, for long times, without tearing, for a wide range of different effective viscosities and deformation rates. Given a suitably low strain rate, $\tau_{crit}$ will be substantially larger than the other timescales of interest. For $\tau_r < \tau_{crit}$, modulating filament recycling times can tune the network between two regimes. For $\tau_r > \tau_c$, the deformation is limited by effective cross-link friction. The effective viscosity depends on the strength of inter-filament cross-linking and the network's architecture, and is relatively insensitive to changes in recycling rate. For $\tau_r < \tau_c$, the deformation is governed by the buildup of elastic stress on network filaments, and effective viscosity becomes strongly dependent on recycling time. 

These findings are in agreement with previous simulations of passive creep in cross-linked networks subjected to extensional stress  \cite{Kim2014526} .  Kim et al considered  a different form of filament turnover (filament treadmilling) in networks with irreversible cross links. They identified two regimes of deformation depending on the level of applied stress and the filament turnover rate: a stress-dependent regime in which filaments turnover before they are strained to an elastic limit and network deformation is linearly viscous and tuned by the turnover rate; and a stress-independent regime in which filaments reach an elastic limit before turning over and the creep rate depends only on the turnover rate, and is insensitive to variation in applied stress. The short recycling time regime ($\tau_r < \tau_c$) that we observe, in which the mechanics are governed by filament extension, is directly equivalent to the stress-dependent regime described by Kim et al. For this regime, our model yields a theoretical description of the effective viscosity found in \cite{Kim2014526}. The $\tau_r > \tau_c$ regime that we observe here corresponds to the stress-independent regime of \cite{Kim2014526}, but with a key difference.   in \cite{Kim2014526}, there was no cross-link unbinding so without of filament turnover, the network would not deform beyond its elastic limit. In contrast, our simulations always require non-zero cross-link slip so there is always some viscous network deformation. Therefore, in the regime of long recycling times our model approaches the limit of cross-link dominated viscosity whereas the model of \cite{Kim2014526} approached an infinite viscosity limit.

Total network strain also increases with the applied myosin force $\upsilon$. Note that the extent of contraction approaches an asymptotic limit as the stiffness asymmetry approaches a ratio of $\sim 100$.}
\end{figure}

Previous theoretical and experimental studies\cite{1367-2630-14-3-033037,rheo_2D1,rheo_active} identified asymmetric filament compliance and dispersion in motor force  as minimal requirements for contraction of disordered networks. To test if our simple implementation of these two requirements (see Models section) was sufficient to produce macroscopic contraction, we simulated active networks that were unconstrained by external attachments.  Turning on motor activity in an initially unstrained network at $t=0$ produced a rapid initial contraction, followed by a progressive buildup of elastic stress due to compression of individual filaments and an $\sim$exponential approach to stall (Figure \ref{fig:active_con}). The time to stall, $\tau_s$, scaled as $L\xi/\upsilon$ (see \nameref{fig:active_supp}b), although the origins of this scaling relationship remain unclear.  On a longer timescale, polarity sorting of individual filaments, as previously described \cite{Ndlec:1997aa,Surrey1167} rearranged the entire network, undoing the initial contraction (see \nameref{active_con_video}).  


During the rapid initial contraction, bulk network strain matched closely the mean compressive strain on individual filaments Figure \ref{fig:active_con}b, confirming that the origin of bulk contraction in our simulations is due to asymmetric filament compliance, as predicted by \cite{1367-2630-14-3-033037,PhysRevX.4.041002} and observed experimentally\cite{rheo_2D1}. Contraction only occurred when the fractional motor activity $0<\phi<1$ (i.e. the fraction of filament intersections with active motors) was less than one, confirming the requirement for dispersion of motor activity (see \nameref{fig:active_supp}). Thus, our model effectively captures a minimal mechanism for bulk contractility in disordered networks through asymmetric filament compliance and dispersion of motor activity.

We also determined how microscale parameters shape the rate and final extent of network contraction. Consistent with the idea that contraction stalls when the elastic resistance to filament compression balances the contractile stress, the final extent of contraction increased sharply with motor activity ($\upsilon$) and with the asymmetry in filament stiffness (i.e. the ratio of the extensional and compressive stiffnesses $\mu_e/\mu_c$) as shown in Figure \ref{fig:active_con}c.

\end{figure}

The previous results reveal internal limits on the contraction of networks with free boundaries.  However networks typically build force and contract against an external resistance.  Therefore, we also analyzed the buildup and maintenance of contractile stress in active networks contracting against a rigid boundary. We simulated active networks contracting from an initially unstressed state against a fixed boundary (Figure \ref{fig:active_str}a), and  monitored the time evolution of mean extensional (blue), compressional (red) and total (black) stress on network filaments (Figure \ref{fig:active_str}b). We observed the same qualitative behavior for all network parameters examined: Total stress built rapidly to a peak value $\sigma_a$, and then decayed back to zero again.  Sampling these dynamics over a large range of network parameters, we found that the peak stress occurred at a characteristic time, $\tau_a\sim L\xi/\sqrt{\mu_e\upsilon}$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:active_str}c. Although, the origins of this peculiar scaling are unclear, the measurement agrees with our intuitive predictions: The time to reach peak stress should increase with increased cross-link coupling ($\xi$) and filament length ($L$), and it should decrease with increasing filament stiffness ($\mu_e$) and motor force ($\upsilon$).  

The slower falloff of active stress involves two contributions:  the first is slow dissipation of extensional stress on network filaments (blue curve in Figure \ref{fig:active_str}b), reflecting a decrease in active stress generation. A similar effect was recently documented in detailed simulations of cross-linked actomyosin networks, where it was associated with large scale reorganization and collapse of network structure \cite{Mak:2016aa}.  Here, we find that significant dissipation of extensional stress can also occur through more local rearrangements without loss of network structure (Figure \ref{fig:active_str}a,b).  The second contribution (which to our knowledge has not been previously described) involves a gradual buildup of compressional stress (red curve in Figure \ref{fig:active_str}b), that balances the active stress at steady state such the the total stress exerted on the network boundary falls to zero.  This buildup of compressional stress occurs through purely local rearrangements in the absence of large scale deformation. 

We were unable to find a simple, universal dependence on network parameters for either dissipation of extensional stress or buildup of compressional stress.  However, for all parameters we sampled, this timescale for decay of stress was significantly longer than the timescale for stress buildup, presumably because the initial buildup involves rapid loading of extensional stress on individual filaments, while the slower dissipation requires local filament rearrangement and a slower buildup of compressive stress. 


\paragraph{Filament recycling allows networks to exert sustained stress on a fixed boundary.}

Note that significant remodeling occurs for longer recycling times. \textbf{b)} Plots of net stress exerted by the network on its boundaries for different recycling times; for long-lived filaments, stress is built rapidly, but then dissipates.

\end{figure}

To explore how the fall-off in stress could be relieved by filament recycling, we again considered an active network contracting against a fixed boundary, using the same parameters as in Figure \ref{fig:active_str}, but now systematically varying filament recycling rates. Adding filament recycling produced two general effects: First, as in the passive case (Figure 4), filament recycling could prevent catastrophic tearing by continuously repairing local structural heterogeneities, and by steadily opposing the effects of local strain thinning (see \nameref{fig:tear_supp}). Second, we found that filament recycling resulted in biphasic modulation of the level of steady state stress.

For the same network parameters as in Figure \ref{fig:active_str}a and slow filament recycling ($\tau_r = 1000 s$), the network stress built rapidly, peaked, and then fell to a lower value that persisted for times much longer than $\tau_a$. Up to a certain point, decreasing recycling time produced a monotonic increase in the steady state stress, although the steady state stress remained lower than its peak value. However, beyond this point, further decreases in recycling time lead to decreases in the steady state stress as well as sharp decreases in the peak stress. 

We reasoned that this bimodal dependence of steady state stress on recycling rates emerges from continuous replacement of strained with unstrained filaments, combined with the different timescales for buildup of extensional stress vs the slower network rearrangement and buildup of compressive  stress (Figure \ref{fig:active_rec}b). If so, then lowering the recycling time $\tau_c$ should increase net stress until $\tau_c$ is approximately equal to $\tau_a$, the time required to build peak stress from an initially unstressed state. For shorter recycling times, the average filament will not have time to build maximum extensional stress before turning over, and thus the steady state stress should decrease with further decreases in $\tau_c$. Indeed, plotting normalized steady state stress (steady state stress/peak stress) vs normalized recycling time ($\tau_c$ /$\tau_a$) confirmed that this biphasic dependence of steady state stress on recycling times holds for a large range of sampled values of network parameters (Figure \ref{fig:active_rec}d).


Similar to the passive response (i.e. Equation \ref{eqn:simple_eta}), we can approximate the dependence of the steady state stress on the filament recycling rate using a simple equation. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:simple_sigma}
\sigma_{ss} = \frac{\sigma_{peak}}{(\tau_r/\tau_a)^n+\tau_a/\tau_r}  
\end{equation}

For $\tau_r\gg\tau_a$, this simplifies to $\sigma_{ss}\sim(\tau_a/\tau_r)^n$, while for $\tau_r\ll\tau_a$, this simplifies to $\sigma_{ss}\sim\tau_r/\tau_a$. What sets the scaling $n$ remains unclear, and this scaling does not appear to be consistent across all simulation setups (Figure \ref{fig:active_rec}d). However, equation \ref{eqn:simple_sigma} still captures a qualitatively correct description of steady state stress in our simulation data.










% COMBINED SECTION
\subsection*{Filament recycling tunes the balance between active stress buildup and viscous stress relaxation to generate flows}

Thus far, we have considered independently how filament recycling tunes effective viscosity during passive deformation in response to an externally applied stress, and how filament recycling tunes the steady state stress produced by an active network against an external resistance. We next sought to characterize how filament recycling tunes the steady flows produced by gradients of motor activity as regions of high motor activity contract against the passive resistance of a neighboring region with no motor activity.

We imposed a continuously asymmetric distribution of motor activity on an initially uniformly dense network of passively cross-linked filaments by allowing a fraction of cross links to be active only in the right half of the simulation domain. Then we examined the time-dependent deformation of the network for a range of different filament recycling times (Figure \ref{fig:flow_ex}a). We observed a sharp dependence of steady flow on filament recycling rate (Figure \ref{fig:flow_ex}b,c). For very long recycling times, ($\tau_r=1000 s$, dark blue line), there was a rapid initial deformation (contraction of the active domain and dilation of the passive domain), followed by a slow approach to a steady state flow characterized by slow contraction of the right half-domain and a matching dilation of the left half-domain (see \nameref{fig:combo_prof}).  However, with decreasing filament recycling times, we found the network was able to largely sustain its deformation and that the long term strain rate remained relatively high (Figure \ref{fig:flow_ex}c).  We repeated these measurements for more network parameters and found that at the shortest recycling timescales measured, we still saw the effective viscosity remaining relatively high, indicating that for short recycling times the effective viscosity may be somewhat buffered against variation in recycling times (Figure \ref{fig:flow_ex}d).

\end{figure}

This dependence of steady state deformation (flow) rate on filament recycling times can be understood in terms of our previous findings.  During steady state flow, active contraction of the right half-domain is limited both by internal resistance to compression of filaments within the right half-domain (Figure 5), and by passive resistance of the left-half domain (Figure 4).  

Using physiologically relevant values for network parameters (described above) sets up a condition where compressional resistance on filaments in the contracting right half domain takes longer to build than extensional resistance on filaments in the dilating right half-domain (i.e. $\tau_c<\tau_s$). As a consequence, except for very low recycling rates ($\tau_r>\tau_{crit}$),  steady state deformation is governed by an equation of the form:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:everybody_knows_that}
\dot{\gamma} = \frac{\sigma_{ss}}{\eta_r}  
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{ss}$ is the active stress generated by the right half-domain (less the internal resistance to filament compression), $\eta_r$ is the effective viscosity of the left half domain and strain rate is measured in the left half-domain.  Therefore, we can understand the dependence of network flow (i.e. strain rate) on filament recycling time $\tau_r$ in terms of the previously characterized dependencies of effective viscosity and steady state stress on $\tau_r$ (Figures \ref{fig:passive_rec}d and \ref{fig:active_rec}d). In particular, recall that there is a transition in the dependence of $\eta_r$ on $\tau_r$ at the characteristic time $\tau_c$, and a transition in the dependence of $\sigma$ on $\tau_r$ at the characteristic time $\tau_a$.  Thus, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:flow_theo},  there are two qualitatively distinct cases for the dependence of strain rate on $\tau_r$, depending on the relative magnitudes of $\tau_a$ and $\tau_c$.  For both cases, we expect a decrease in strain rate with filament recycling at long recycling times (where effective viscosity is insensitive to strain rate)  and approach to a slowly varying strain rate at low recycling times, where both $\eta_r$ and $\sigma_{ss}$ fall off with different scalings. For $\tau_a < \tau_c$, we predict a peak strain rate at intermediate recycling times followed by a rapid falloff at lower recycling times, whereas for $\tau_a > \tau_c$, we expect a more rapid approach to maximum strain rate and a slower fall off at lower recycling times.  As shown in Figure \ref{fig:flow_theo}d, for the range of network parameters we sampled, the strain rate rapidly increases as $\tau_r$ is lowered towards $\tau_a$ and then more slowly decays to 0 as $\tau_r$ is further decreased.  This is to be expected because all the parameter values sampled (selected for physiological relevance) satisfied the condition $\tau_a > \tau_c$.












%Conclusion
\section*{Conclusion}
Our work aimed to create a simulation framework that would allow us to analyze the origins of macroscopic flow in terms of a handful of physiologically relevant microscopic parameters.  Toward this aim we developed a minimalist model of a 2D filament network and analyzed the network's reaction to a variety of situations.  We found mathematical relationships that determined both the passive effective viscosity and the active stress generation of networks with and without recycling.  From these relationships we were able to make predictions about the rates of network flow in non-isotropic networks mimicking those found in polarized eukaryotic actomyosin cortices.  

Importantly, our work brings a theoretical understanding to the importance of actomyosin turnover in producing and maintaining long-term large scale flows.  We propose the concept of "filament recycling" to refer to the multitude of biochemical interactions which can give rise to the piece by piece architectural resetting of filament networks.  We believe that our analysis of networks in the presence of this filament recycling will be useful in further developing the qualitative and quantitative understanding the deformation of these complex networks.
