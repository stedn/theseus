	Abstract = {Actomyosin interactions lie at the heart of fundamental cellular processes{\textemdash}including morphogenesis, establishment of polarity, and overall motility{\textemdash}but the general principles driving the spatiotempotal orchestration of these interactions have remained elusive. Working in vitro, using micropatterned substrates, Reymann et al. (p. 1310) demonstrate that myosins can use a {\textquotedblleft}selection orientation{\textquotedblright} mechanism to pull selectively on actin filaments, contract the actin network and disassemble it, or walk on the filaments, align them, allow their growth, and control filament orientation.The organization of actin filaments into higher-ordered structures governs eukaryotic cell shape and movement. Global actin network size and architecture are maintained in a dynamic steady state through regulated assembly and disassembly. Here, we used experimentally defined actin structures in vitro to investigate how the activity of myosin motors depends on network architecture. Direct visualization of filaments revealed myosin-induced actin network deformation. During this reorganization, myosins selectively contracted and disassembled antiparallel actin structures, while parallel actin bundles remained unaffected. The local distribution of nucleation sites and the resulting orientation of actin filaments appeared to regulate the scalability of the contraction process. This {\textquotedblleft}orientation selection{\textquotedblright} mechanism for selective contraction and disassembly suggests how the dynamics of the cellular actin cytoskeleton can be spatially controlled by actomyosin contractility.},

	Abstract = {Summary Actomyosin contractility plays a central role in a wide range of cellular processes, including the establishment of cell polarity, cell migration, tissue integrity, and morphogenesis during development. The contractile response is variable and depends on actomyosin network architecture and biochemical composition. To determine how this coupling regulates actomyosin-driven contraction, we used a micropatterning method that enables the spatial control of actin assembly. We generated a variety of actin templates and measured how defined actin structures respond to myosin-induced forces. We found that the same actin filament crosslinkers either enhance or inhibit the contractility of a network, depending on the organization of actin within the network. Numerical simulations unified the roles of actin filament branching and crosslinking during actomyosin contraction. Specifically, we introduce the concept of ``network connectivity'' and show that the contractions of distinct actin architectures are described by the same master curve when considering their degree of connectivity. This makes it possible to predict the dynamic response of defined actin structures to transient changes in connectivity. We propose that, depending on the connectivity and the architecture, network contraction is dominated by either sarcomeric-like or buckling mechanisms. More generally, this study reveals how actin network contractility depends on its architecture under a defined set of biochemical conditions. },

@article{Lai:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Cell migration is initiated by lamellipodia---membrane-enclosed sheets of cytoplasm containing densely packed actin filament networks. Although the molecular details of network turnover remain obscure, recent work points towards key roles in filament nucleation for Arp2/3 complex and its activator WAVE complex. Here, we combine fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of different lamellipodial components with a new method of data analysis to shed light on the dynamics of actin assembly/disassembly. We show that Arp2/3 complex is incorporated into the network exclusively at the lamellipodium tip, like actin, at sites coincident with WAVE complex accumulation. Capping protein likewise showed a turnover similar to actin and Arp2/3 complex, but was confined to the tip. In contrast, cortactin---another prominent Arp2/3 complex regulator---and ADF/cofilin---previously implicated in driving both filament nucleation and disassembly---were rapidly exchanged throughout the lamellipodium. These results suggest that Arp2/3- and WAVE complex-driven actin filament nucleation at the lamellipodium tip is uncoupled from the activities of both cortactin and cofilin. Network turnover is additionally regulated by the spatially segregated activities of capping protein at the tip and cofilin throughout the mesh.},

@article{Carlsson:2010aa,
	Abstract = {The dynamic nature of actin in cells manifests itself in many ways: Polymerization near the cell edge is balanced by depolymerization in the interior, externally induced actin polymerization is followed by depolymerization, and spontaneous oscillations of the cell periphery are frequently seen. I discuss how mathematical modeling relates quantitative measures of actin dynamics to the rates of underlying molecular level processes. The rate of actin incorporation at the leading edge of a moving cell is roughly consistent with existing theories, and the factors determining the characteristic time of actin polymerization are fairly well understood. However, our understanding of actin disassembly is limited, in particular the interplay between severing and depolymerization and the role of specific combinations of proteins in implementing disassembly events. The origins of cell-edge oscillations, and their possible relation to actin waves, are a fruitful area of future research.},

@article{Fritzschee1501337,
	Abstract = {The actin cortex of animal cells is the main determinant of cellular mechanics. The continuous turnover of cortical actin filaments enables cells to quickly respond to stimuli. Recent work has shown that most of the cortical actin is generated by only two actin nucleators, the Arp2/3 complex and the formin Diaph1. However, our understanding of their interplay, their kinetics, and the length distribution of the filaments that they nucleate within living cells is poor. Such knowledge is necessary for a thorough comprehension of cellular processes and cell mechanics from basic polymer physics principles. We determined cortical assembly rates in living cells by using single-molecule fluorescence imaging in combination with stochastic simulations. We find that formin-nucleated filaments are, on average, 10 times longer than Arp2/3-nucleated filaments. Although formin-generated filaments represent less than 10\% of all actin filaments, mechanical measurements indicate that they are important determinants of cortical elasticity. Tuning the activity of actin nucleators to alter filament length distribution may thus be a mechanism allowing cells to adjust their macroscopic mechanical properties to their physiological needs.},

@article{De-La-Cruz:2009aa,
	Abstract = {The actin regulatory protein, cofilin, promotes actin assembly dynamics by severing filaments and increasing the number of ends from which subunits add and dissociate. Recent studies provide biophysical descriptions of cooperative filament interactions in energetic, mechanical and structural terms. A one-dimensional Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions permits thermodynamic analysis of cooperative binding and indicates that one or a few cofilin molecules can sever a filament. Binding and cooperative interactions are entropically driven. A significant fraction of the binding free energy results from the linked dissociation of filament-associated ions (polyelectrolyte effect), which modulate filament structure, stability and mechanics. The remaining binding free energy and essentially all of the cooperative free energy arise from the enhanced conformational dynamics of the cofilactin complex. Filament mechanics are modulated by cofilin such that cofilin-saturated filaments are approximately 10- to 20-fold more compliant in bending and twisting than bare filaments. Cofilin activity is well described by models in which discontinuities in topology, mechanics and conformational dynamics generate stress concentration and promote fracture at junctions of bare and decorated segments, analogous to the grain boundary fracture of crystalline materials and the thermally driven formation of shear transformation zones in colloidal glass.},

@article{Janson1005,
	Abstract = {The actin-based cytoskeleton is a dynamic component of living cells with major structural and contractile properties involved in fundamental cellular processes. The action of actin-binding proteins can decrease or increase the gel structure. Changes in the actin-based cytoskeleton have long been thought to modulate the myosin II-based contractions involved in these cellular processes, but there has been some debate concerning whether maximal gelation increases or decreases contractile activity. To address this question, we have examined how contractile activity is modulated by the extent of actin gelation. The model system consists of physiologically relevant concentrations and molar ratios of actin filaments (whose lengths are controlled by gelsolin), the actin-cross-linking protein filamin, and smooth muscle myosin II. This system has been studied at the macroscopic and light microscopic levels to relate the gel structure to the rate of contraction. We present results which show that while a minimal amount of structure is necessary to transmit the contractile force, increasing the gel structure inhibits the rate of contraction, despite an increase in the actin-activated Mg(2+)-ATPase activity of myosin. Decreasing the total myosin concentration also inhibits the rate of contraction. Application of cytochalasin D to one side of the contractile network increases the rate of contraction and also induces movement comparable to flare streaming observed in isolated amoeba cytoplasm. These results are interpreted relative to current models of the relationship between the state of gelation and contraction and to the potential effects of such a relationship in the living cell.},

	Abstract = {Cells actively produce contractile forces for a variety of processes including cytokinesis and motility. Contractility is known to rely on myosin \{II\} motors which convert chemical energy from \{ATP\} hydrolysis into forces on actin filaments. However, the basic physical principles of cell contractility remain poorly understood. We reconstitute contractility in a simplified model system of purified F-actin, muscle myosin \{II\} motors, and α-actinin cross-linkers. We show that contractility occurs above a threshold motor concentration and within a window of cross-linker concentrations. We also quantify the pore size of the bundled networks and find contractility to occur at a critical distance between the bundles. We propose a simple mechanism of contraction based on myosin filaments pulling neighboring bundles together into an aggregated structure. Observations of this reconstituted system in both bulk and low-dimensional geometries show that the contracting gels pull on and deform their surface with a contractile force of ∼1 μN, or ∼100 pN per F-actin bundle. Cytoplasmic extracts contracting in identical environments show a similar behavior and dependence on myosin as the reconstituted system. Our results suggest that cellular contractility can be sensitively regulated by tuning the (local) activity of molecular motors and the cross-linker density and binding affinity. },

@article{Benink:2000aa,
	Abstract = {Cortical flow, the directed movement of cortical F-actin and cortical organelles, is a basic cellular motility process. Microtubules are thought to somehow direct cortical flow, but whether they do so by stimulating or inhibiting contraction of the cortical actin cytoskeleton is the subject of debate. Treatment of Xenopus oocytes with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) triggers cortical flow toward the animal pole of the oocyte; this flow is suppressed by microtubules. To determine how this suppression occurs and whether it can control the direction of cortical flow, oocytes were subjected to localized manipulation of either the contractile stimulus (PMA) or microtubules. Localized PMA application resulted in redirection of cortical flow toward the site of application, as judged by movement of cortical pigment granules, cortical F-actin, and cortical myosin-2A. Such redirected flow was accelerated by microtubule depolymerization, showing that the suppression of cortical flow by microtubules is independent of the direction of flow. Direct observation of cortical F-actin by time-lapse confocal analysis in combination with photobleaching showed that cortical flow is driven by contraction of the cortical F-actin network and that microtubules suppress this contraction. The oocyte germinal vesicle serves as a microtubule organizing center in Xenopus oocytes; experimental displacement of the germinal vesicle toward the animal pole resulted in localized flow away from the animal pole. The results show that 1) cortical flow is directed toward areas of localized contraction of the cortical F-actin cytoskeleton; 2) microtubules suppress cortical flow by inhibiting contraction of the cortical F-actin cytoskeleton; and 3) localized, microtubule-dependent suppression of actomyosin-based contraction can control the direction of cortical flow. We discuss these findings in light of current models of cortical flow.},

@article{Yumura200,
	Abstract = {Actin and myosin II play major roles in cell migration. Whereas pseudopod extension by actin polymerization has been intensively researched, less attention has been paid to how the rest of the actin cytoskeleton such as the actin cortex contributes to cell migration. In this study, cortical actin and myosin II filaments were simultaneously observed in migrating Dictyostelium cells under total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. The cortical actin and myosin II filaments remained stationary with respect to the substratum as the cells advanced. However, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments and direct observation of filaments showed that they rapidly turned over. When the cells were detached from the substratum, the actin and myosin filaments displayed a vigorous retrograde flow. Thus, when the cells migrate on the substratum, the cortical cytoskeleton firmly holds the substratum to generate the motive force instead. The present studies also demonstrate how myosin II localizes to the rear region of the migrating cells. The observed dynamic turnover of actin and myosin II filaments contributes to the recycling of their subunits across the whole cell and enables rapid reorganization of the cytoskeleton.},

	Abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, microtubules and their associated motor proteins can be organized into various large-scale patterns. Using a simplified experimental system combined with computer simulations, we examined how the concentrations and kinetic parameters of the motors contribute to their collective behavior. We observed self-organization of generic steady-state structures such as asters, vortices, and a network of interconnected poles. We identified parameter combinations that determine the generation of each of these structures. In general, this approach may become useful for correlating the morphogenetic phenomena taking place in a biological system with the biophysical characteristics of its constituents.},

@article{Alvarado:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Living systems naturally exhibit internal driving: active, molecular processes drive non-equilibrium phenomena such as metabolism or migration. Active gels constitute a fascinating class of internally driven matter, in which molecular motors exert localized stresses inside polymer networks. There is evidence that network crosslinking is required to allow motors to induce macroscopic contraction. Yet a quantitative understanding of how network connectivity enables contraction is lacking. Here we show experimentally that myosin motors contract crosslinked actin polymer networks to clusters with a scale-free size distribution. This critical behaviour occurs over an unexpectedly broad range of crosslink concentrations. To understand this robustness, we developed a quantitative model of contractile networks that takes into account network restructuring: motors reduce connectivity by forcing crosslinks to unbind. Paradoxically, to coordinate global contractions, motor activity should be low. Otherwise, motors drive initially well-connected networks to a critical state where ruptures form across the entire network.},

	Abstract = {We present a generic formulation of the continuum elasticity of an isotropic crosslinked active gel. The gel is described by a two-component model consisting of an elastic network coupled frictionally to a permeating fluid. Activity is induced by active crosslinkers that undergo an ATP-activated cycle and transmit forces to the network. The on/off dynamics of the active crosslinkers is described via rate equations for unbound and bound motors. For large activity motors yield a contractile instability of the network. At intermediate activity{,} the on/off motor dynamics provides an effective inertial drag on the network that opposes elastic restoring forces{,} resulting in spontaneous oscillations. Our work provides a continuum formulation that unifies earlier microscopic models of oscillations in muscle sarcomeres and a generic framework for the description of the large scale properties of isotropic active solids.},

@article{Cramer19991095,
	Abstract = {Background: In motile cells, protrusion of the lamellipodium (a type of cell margin) requires assembly of actin monomers into actin filaments at the tip of the lamellipodium. The importance of actin-filament disassembly in this process is less well understood, and is assessed here using the actin drug jasplakinolide, which has two known activities -- inhibition of filament disassembly and induction of an increase in actin polymer. Results: In cells the two activities of jasplakinolide were found to be separable; 1 μM jasplakinolide could permeate cells, bind cellular filamentous actin (F-actin) and inhibit filament disassembly within 3.5 minutes, but significant increase in actin polymer was not detected until 60 minutes of treatment. In live, permeabilised cells, jasplakinolide did not inhibit filament assembly from supplied, purified actin monomers. In migrating chick fibroblasts, lamellipodium protrusion was blocked within 1--5 minutes of treatment with 1 μM jasplakinolide, without any perturbation of actin organisation. In non-migrating chick fibroblasts, there was a delay in the onset of jasplakinolide-induced inhibition of lamellipodium protrusion, during which lamellipodium length increased linearly with no increase in protrusion rate. Motility of the bacterium Listeria in infected PtK2 cells was reduced 2.3-fold within 3 minutes of treatment with 1 μM jasplakinolide. Conclusions: Actin-filament disassembly is tightly coupled to lamellipodium protrusion in migrating chick fibroblasts and motility of Listeria in PtK2 cells. One simple interpretation of these data is a situation whereby ongoing actin-filament assembly uses free actin monomer derived from filament disassembly, in preference to stored monomer. },

@article{Fritzsche15032013,
	Abstract = {The cell cortex is a thin network of actin, myosin motors, and associated proteins that underlies the plasma membrane in most eukaryotic cells. It enables cells to resist extracellular stresses, perform mechanical work, and change shape. Cortical structural and mechanical properties depend strongly on the relative turnover rates of its constituents, but quantitative data on these rates remain elusive. Using photobleaching experiments, we analyzed the dynamics of three classes of proteins within the cortex of living cells: a scaffold protein (actin), a cross-linker (α-actinin), and a motor (myosin). We found that two filament subpopulations with very different turnover rates composed the actin cortex: one with fast turnover dynamics and polymerization resulting from addition of monomers to free barbed ends, and one with slow turnover dynamics with polymerization resulting from formin-mediated filament growth. Our data suggest that filaments in the second subpopulation are on average longer than those in the first and that cofilin-mediated severing of formin-capped filaments contributes to replenishing the filament subpopulation with free barbed ends. Furthermore, α-actinin and myosin minifilaments turned over significantly faster than F-actin. Surprisingly, only one-fourth of α-actinin dimers were bound to two actin filaments. Taken together, our results provide a quantitative characterization of essential mechanisms under-lying actin cortex homeostasis.},

	Abstract = {In the past few years, advances in microscopy and quantitative image analysis have lead to a completely new understanding of the processes underlying the cell shape changes and cell rearrangements that drive tissue morphogenesis. In a handful of tissues so far, though the number will surely increase rapidly, it has been shown that cell behaviour is not continuous but proceeds in pulses driven by the contractile activity of dynamic cortical actomyosin networks. The patterns and dynamics of temporary subcellular contractile foci, driven by local increases in actin and myosin, are remarkably similar in disparate tissues. Cells in all tissues display a similar range of intervals between contractions, with increasing frequencies associated with stronger tissue morphogenesis. Contractile foci appear to flow within cells with speeds that are consistent across tissues. We highlight the difference between contractile tension and stiffness, the latter being a requirement for any ratchet mechanism that stabilises contraction to produce effective tissue morphogenesis. At least two different types of ratchet mechanism are discussed, with the stiffness conferred either by a more stable actomyosin population at cell--cell junctions or through cortical actomyosin forming a quasi-stable supra-cellular network. Pulsatile contractions, polarized cell organization and various stiffening ratchet mechanisms combine to provide a rich variety of options for robust epithelial tissue remodelling. },

@article{Hannezo14072015,
	Abstract = {An essential question of morphogenesis is how patterns arise without preexisting positional information, as inspired by Turing. In the past few years, cytoskeletal flows in the cell cortex have been identified as a key mechanism of molecular patterning at the subcellular level. Theoretical and in vitro studies have suggested that biological polymers such as actomyosin gels have the property to self-organize, but the applicability of this concept in an in vivo setting remains unclear. Here, we report that the regular spacing pattern of supracellular actin rings in the Drosophila tracheal tubule is governed by a self-organizing principle. We propose a simple biophysical model where pattern formation arises from the interplay of myosin contractility and actin turnover. We validate the hypotheses of the model using photobleaching experiments and report that the formation of actin rings is contractility dependent. Moreover, genetic and pharmacological perturbations of the physical properties of the actomyosin gel modify the spacing of the pattern, as the model predicted. In addition, our model posited a role of cortical friction in stabilizing the spacing pattern of actin rings. Consistently, genetic depletion of apical extracellular matrix caused strikingly dynamic movements of actin rings, mirroring our model prediction of a transition from steady to chaotic actin patterns at low cortical friction. Our results therefore demonstrate quantitatively that a hydrodynamical instability of the actin cortex can trigger regular pattern formation and drive morphogenesis in an in vivo setting.},

This mechanism relies on the regulation of contractility by myosin, whose transport is explicitly taken into account in the model. Theoretical predictions are compared to experimental data of tumor cells migrating in three-dimensional matrigel and suggest that this mechanism could be a general mode of cell migration in three-dimensional environments. },

Force generation by actin-myosin networks and force transmission through adhesive complexes are two self-organizing phenomena driving tissue morphogenesis. Coordination and integration of forces by long-range force transmission and mechanosensing of cells within tissues produce large-scale tissue shape changes. Extrinsic mechanical forces also control tissue patterning by modulating cell fate specification and differentiation. Thus, the interplay between tissue mechanics and biochemical signaling orchestrates tissue morphogenesis and patterning in development. },

	Abstract = {We have examined the cortex of Caenorhabditis elegans eggs during pseudocleavage (PC), a period of the first cell cycle which is important for the generation of asymmetry at first cleavage (Strome, S. 1989. Int. Rev. Cytol. 114: 81-123). We have found that directed, actin dependent, cytoplasmic, and cortical flow occurs during this period coincident with a rearrangement of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (Strome, S. 1986. J. Cell Biol. 103: 2241-2252). The flow velocity (4-7 microns/min) is similar to previously determined particle movements driven by cortical actin flows in motile cells. We show that directed flows occur in one of the daughters of the first division that itself divides asymmetrically, but not in its sister that divides symmetrically. The cortical and cytoplasmic events of PC can be mimicked in other cells during cytokinesis by displacing the mitotic apparatus with the microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole. In all cases, the polarity of the resulting cortical and cytoplasmic flows correlates with the position of the attenuated mitotic spindle formed. These cortical flows are also accompanied by a change in the distribution of the cortical actin network. The polarity of this redistribution is similarly correlated with the location of the attenuated spindle. These observations suggest a mechanism for generating polarized flows of cytoplasmic and cortical material during embryonic cleavages. We present a model for the events of PC and suggest how the poles of the mitotic spindle mediate the formation of the contractile ring during cytokinesis in C. elegans.},

@article{Imafuku1999359,
	Abstract = {The sliding movement of an actin filament generated by myosin heads with MgGTP bound is much slower than that by those with MgATP bound. Nonetheless, there is a report that the actin sliding velocity at low (11--21 μM) MgATP concentrations is increased by the addition of MgGTP in a range of 1--3 mM, although the actin sliding velocity at these MgATP concentrations is larger than the maximum sliding velocity attained in the presence of MgGTP alone. The convex rise in the velocity was called ``mutual sensitization of MgATP and MgGTP'' in the report. Here we propose a theoretical model to account for the mutual sensitization of MgATP and MgGTP. The model is an extension of a protein friction model, accommodating the presence of two different substrates and assuming the presence of motile and non-motile myosins. This new model is in accord with the characteristics of the actin/myosin sliding movement experimentally observed in mixtures of MgATP and MgGTP. Comparison of the model with the experimental results implies that the non-motile and motile myosins are those with the ``converse and correct'' orientations of their heads with respect to the direction of the actin sliding movement in vitro . },

	Abstract = { This short review presents a qualitative introduction to the hydrodynamic theory of active polar gels and its applications to the mechanics of the cytoskeleton. Active polar gels are viscoelastic materials formed by polar filaments maintained in a nonequilibrium state by constant consumption of energy. In the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells, actin filaments are treadmilling and form a viscoelastic gel interacting with myosin molecular motors driven by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate; one can thus consider the actomyosin cytoskeleton as an active polar gel. The hydrodynamic description is generic as it only relies on symmetry arguments. We first use the hydrodynamic approach to discuss the spontaneous generation of flow in an active polar film. Then we give two examples of applications to lamellipodium motility and to instabilities of cortical actin. },

Our theory is motivated by the cytoskeleton which is a network of elastic filaments that are coupled to active processes such as the action of motor proteins which can generate relative forces between filaments as they hydrolyze a fuel (ATP). In addition to the filament gel, the system is embedded in a solvent component and free monomers constitute a third component. We derive constitutive material equations for the combined system which include reactive and dissipative couplings as well as the chemical driving by ATP hydrolysis and a possible chiral symmetry of the filaments. As an illustration of these equations, we discuss an active liquid in a simple shear gradient.},

	Abstract = { The self-organization of actin filaments is a topic that links cell biology with condensed matter physics. In vitro assays allow precise manipulation of component mechanical and chemical properties, needed for rigorous tests of theoretical models. We review recent work on in vitro motility assays that documented emergence of ordered actin filament microdomains powered by myosin motor proteins at high filament densities. Motor and filament surface density and mechanochemical cycle kinetics are additional parameters under current investigation. Individual filament collisions have been studied in order to elucidate the emergent population behavior. Apolar, weak interactions evidenced by local filament deformations during crossover events are attenuated at high motor densities. Theoretical analysis requires refinement of rigid rod filament models. In intact cells, accessory proteins modulate actin filament length, bundling or sliding and this gives rise to complex emergent structures and behaviors such as cell motility and chemotaxis. The development of generic, mechanical and biochemical frameworks with predictive power that link molecular properties with micro- and macroscopic phenomena seen in living cells requires dialogue between theoreticians and experimentalists. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The actin cortex has a well-documented ability to rapidly remodel and flow while maintaining long-range connectivity, but how this is achieved remains poorly understood. Here, we use computer simulations to explore how stress relaxation in cross-linked actin networks subjected to extensional stress depends on the interplay between network architecture and turnover. We characterize a regime in which a network response is nonaffine and stress relaxation is governed by the continuous dissipation of elastic energy via cyclic formation, elongation, and turnover of tension-bearing elements. Within this regime, for a wide range of network parameters, we observe a constant deformation (creep) rate that is linearly proportional to the rate of filament turnover, leading to a constant effective viscosity that is inversely proportional to turnover rate. Significantly, we observe a biphasic dependence of the creep rate on applied stress: below a critical stress threshold, the creep rate increases linearly with applied stress; above that threshold, the creep rate becomes independent of applied stress. We show that this biphasic stress dependence can be understood in terms of the nonlinear force-extension behavior of individual force-transmitting network elements. These results have important implications for understanding the origins and control of viscous flows both in the cortex of living cells and in other polymer networks. },

	Abstract = {We describe an active polymer network in which processive molecular motors control network elasticity. This system consists of actin filaments cross-linked by filamin A (FLNa) and contracted by bipolar filaments of muscle myosin II. The myosin motors stiffen the network by more than two orders of magnitude by pulling on actin filaments anchored in the network by FLNa cross-links, thereby generating internal stress. The stiffening response closely mimics the effects of external stress applied by mechanical shear. Both internal and external stresses can drive the network into a highly nonlinear, stiffened regime. The active stress reaches values that are equivalent to an external stress of 14 Pa, consistent with a 1-pN force per myosin head. This active network mimics many mechanical properties of cells and suggests that adherent cells exert mechanical control by operating in a nonlinear regime where cell stiffness is sensitive to changes in motor activity. This design principle may be applicable to engineering novel biologically inspired, active materials that adjust their own stiffness by internal catalytic control.},

	Abstract = {Actomyosin contractility is essential for biological force generation, and is well understood in highly organized structures such as striated muscle. Additionally, actomyosin bundles devoid of this organization are known to contract both in vivo and in vitro , which cannot be described by standard muscle models. To narrow down the search for possible contraction mechanisms in these systems, we investigate their microscopic symmetries. We show that contractile behavior requires non-identical motors that generate large-enough forces to probe the nonlinear elastic behavior of F-actin. This suggests a role for filament buckling in the contraction of these bundles, consistent with recent experimental results on reconstituted actomyosin bundles.},

	Abstract = {Abstract F-actin networks are involved in cell mechanical processes ranging from motility to endocytosis. The mesoscale architecture of assemblies of individual F-actin polymers that gives rise to micrometer-scale rheological properties is poorly understood, despite numerous in vivo and vitro studies. In vitro networks have been shown to organize into spatial patterns when spatially confined, including dense spherical shells inside spherical emulsion droplets. Here we develop a simplified model of an isotropic, compressible, viscoelastic material continually assembling and disassembling. We demonstrate that spherical shells emerge naturally when the strain relaxation rate (corresponding to internal network reorganization) is slower than the disassembly rate (corresponding to F-actin depolymerization). These patterns are consistent with recent experiments, including a collapse of shells to a central high-density focus of F-actin when either assembly or disassembly is reduced with drugs. Our results demonstrate how complex spatio-temporal patterns can emerge without spatially distributed force generation, polar alignment of F-actin polymers, or spatially nonuniform regulation of F-actin by upstream biochemical networks. },

We show that the coupling of the elasticity of the semiflexible filaments to the mechanical properties of the motors leads to contractile behavior of the gel, in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. The motors, however, soften the zero-frequency elastic constant of the gel. When the collective motor dynamics is incorporated in the model, a stiffening of the network at high frequencies is obtained. The frequency controlling the crossover between low- and high-frequency network elasticity is estimated in terms of microscopic properties of motors and filaments, and can be as low as 10 −3  Hz.},

Fast-translocating cells near the wound edge have short filament lifetimes compared with turnover values that proportionately increase in slower moving cells situated at increasing distances from the wound border. Contrasted with slow cells exhibiting slow actin filament turnover speeds, fast cells have less polymerized actin, shorter actin filaments, more free barbed ends, and less actin-associated cofilin. Cultured primary fibroblasts manifest identical relationships between speed and actin turnover as the endothelial cells, and fast fibroblasts expressing gelsolin have higher actin turnover rates than slow fibroblasts that lack this actin-severing protein.

	Abstract = {The C. elegans \{PAR\} proteins PAR-3, PAR-6, and PKC-3 are asymmetrically localized and have essential roles in cell polarity. We show that the one-cell C. elegans embryo contains a dynamic and contractile actomyosin network that appears to be destabilized near the point of sperm entry. This asymmetry initiates a flow of cortical nonmuscle myosin (NMY-2) and F-actin toward the opposite, future anterior, pole. PAR-3, PAR-6, and PKC-3, as well as non-PAR proteins that associate with the cytoskeleton, appear to be transported to the anterior by this cortical flow. In turn, PAR-3, PAR-6, and PKC-3 modulate cortical actomyosin dynamics and promote cortical flow. PAR-2, which localizes to the posterior cortex, inhibits NMY-2 from accumulating at the posterior cortex during flow, thus maintaining asymmetry by preventing inappropriate, posterior-directed flows. Similar actomyosin flows accompany the establishment of \{PAR\} asymmetries that form after the one-cell stage, suggesting that actomyosin-mediated cortical flows have a general role in \{PAR\} asymmetry. },

	Abstract = {Here we develop a minimal model of the cell actomyosin cortex by forming a quasi-2D cross-linked filamentous actin (F-actin) network adhered to a model cell membrane and contracted by myosin thick filaments. Myosin motors generate both compressive and tensile stresses on F-actin and consequently induce large bending fluctuations, which reduces their effective persistence length to <1 μm. Over a large range of conditions, we show the extent of network contraction corresponds exactly to the extent of individual F-actin shortening via buckling. This demonstrates an essential role of buckling in breaking the symmetry between tensile and compressive stresses to facilitate mesoscale network contraction of up to 80% strain. Portions of buckled F-actin with a radius of curvature ∼300 nm are prone to severing and thus compressive stresses mechanically coordinate contractility with F-actin severing, the initial step of F-actin turnover. Finally, the F-actin curvature acquired by myosin-induced stresses can be further constrained by adhesion of the network to a membrane, accelerating filament severing but inhibiting the long-range transmission of the stresses necessary for network contractility. Thus, the extent of membrane adhesion can regulate the coupling between network contraction and F-actin severing. These data demonstrate the essential role of the nonlinear response of F-actin to compressive stresses in potentiating both myosin-mediated contractility and filament severing. This may serve as a general mechanism to mechanically coordinate contractility and cortical dynamics across diverse actomyosin assemblies in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells.},

	Abstract = {Myosin II motors embedded within the actin cortex generate contractile forces to modulate cell shape in essential behaviors, including polarization, migration, and division. In sarcomeres, myosin II--mediated sliding of antiparallel F-actin is tightly coupled to myofibril contraction. By contrast, cortical F-actin is highly disordered in polarity, orientation, and length. How the disordered nature of the actin cortex affects actin and myosin movements and resultant contraction is unknown. Here we reconstitute a model cortex in vitro to monitor the relative movements of actin and myosin under conditions that promote or abrogate network contraction. In weakly contractile networks, myosin can translocate large distances across stationary F-actin. By contrast, the extent of relative actomyosin sliding is attenuated during contraction. Thus actomyosin sliding efficiently drives contraction in actomyosin networks despite the high degree of disorder. These results are consistent with the nominal degree of relative actomyosin movement observed in actomyosin assemblies in nonmuscle cells.},

Signaling pathways converging on WASp/Scar proteins regulate the activity of Arp2/3 complex, which mediates the initiation of new filaments as branches on preexisting filaments. After a brief spurt of growth, capping protein terminates the elongation of the filaments. After filaments have aged by hydrolysis of their bound \{ATP\} and dissociation of the γ phosphate, ADF/cofilin proteins promote debranching and depolymerization. Profilin catalyzes the exchange of \{ADP\} for ATP, refilling the pool of ATP-actin monomers bound to profilin, ready for elongation. },

These equations model the dynamics of polar active agents, embedded in a viscous medium, in which stresses are induced through constant consumption of energy. The numerical method is based on Lagrangian particles and staggered Cartesian finite-difference meshes. We show that the method is second-order and first-order accurate with respect to grid and time-step sizes, respectively. Using the present method, we simulate the hydrodynamics in rectangular geometries, of a passive liquid crystal, of an active polar film and of active gels with topological defects in polarization. We show the emergence of spontaneous flow due to Fr{\'e}edericksz transition, and transformation in the nature of topological defects by tuning the activity of the system. },

We exploited tunable expression via RNAi and a dynamically exchanging monomer pool to achieve fast, continuous single-molecule imaging at optimal densities with signal-to-noise ratios adequate for robust single-particle tracking (SPT). We introduce a method called smPReSS, single-molecule photobleaching relaxation to steady state, that infers exchange rates from quantitative analysis of single-molecule photobleaching kinetics without using SPT. Combining SPT and smPReSS allowed for spatially and temporally resolved measurements of protein mobility and exchange kinetics. We used these methods to (i) resolve distinct mobility states and spatial variation in exchange rates of the polarity protein PAR-6 and (ii) measure spatiotemporal modulation of actin filament assembly and disassembly. These methods offer a promising avenue to investigate dynamic mechanisms that pattern the embryonic cell surface.},

Because the cortex is attached to the cell membrane, it plays a central role in cell shape control. The proteic constituents of the cortex undergo rapid turnover, making the cortex both mechanically rigid and highly plastic, two properties essential to its function. The cortex has recently attracted increasing attention and its functions in cellular processes such as cytokinesis, cell migration, and embryogenesis are progressively being dissected. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the structural organization, composition, and mechanics of the actin cortex, focusing on the link between molecular processes and macroscopic physical properties.

	Abstract = {Cells assemble a variety of bundled actomyosin structures in the cytoskeleton for activities such as cell-shape regulation, force production, and cytokinesis. Although these linear structures exhibit varied architecture, two common organizational themes are a punctate distribution of myosin \{II\} and distinct patterns of actin polarity. The mechanisms that cells use to assemble and maintain these organizational features are poorly understood. To study these, we reconstituted actomyosin bundles in vitro that contained only actin filaments and myosin II. Upon addition of ATP, the bundles contracted and the uniformly distributed myosin spontaneously reorganized into discrete clusters. We developed a mathematical model in which the motion of myosin \{II\} filaments is governed by the polarities of the actin filaments with which they interact. The model showed that the assembly of myosins into clusters is driven by their tendency to migrate to locations with zero net actin filament polarity. With no fitting parameters, the predicted distribution of myosin cluster separations was in close agreement with our experiments, including a −3/2 power law decay for intermediate length scales. Thus, without an organizing template or accessory proteins, a minimal bundle of actin and myosin has the inherent capacity to self-organize into a heterogeneous banded structure. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Cytokinesis is the process of physical cleavage at the end of cell division; it proceeds by ingression of an acto-myosin furrow at the equator of the cell. Its failure leads to multinucleated cells and is a possible cause of tumorigenesis. Here, we calculate the full dynamics of furrow ingression and predict cytokinesis completion above a well-defined threshold of equatorial contractility. The cortical acto-myosin is identified as the main source of mechanical dissipation and active forces. Thereupon, we propose a viscous active nonlinear membrane theory of the cortex that explicitly includes actin turnover and where the active RhoA signal leads to an equatorial band of myosin overactivity. The resulting cortex deformation is calculated numerically, and reproduces well the features of cytokinesis such as cell shape and cortical flows toward the equator. Our theory gives a physical explanation of the independence of cytokinesis duration on cell size in embryos. It also predicts a critical role of turnover on the rate and success of furrow constriction. Scaling arguments allow for a simple interpretation of the numerical results and unveil the key mechanism that generates the threshold for cytokinesis completion: cytoplasmic incompressibility results in a competition between the furrow line tension and the cell poles' surface tension. },

	Abstract = {The protein actin is a part of the cytoskeleton and, therefore, responsible for the mechanical properties of the cells. Starting with the single molecule up to the final structure, actin creates a hierarchical structure of several levels exhibiting a remarkable behavior. The hierarchy spans several length scales and limitations in computational power; therefore, there is a call for different mechanical modeling approaches for the different scales. On the molecular level, we may consider each atom in molecular dynamics simulations. Actin forms filaments by combining the molecules into a double helix. In a model, we replace molecular subdomains using coarse-graining methods, allowing the investigation of larger systems of several atoms. These models on the nanoscale inform continuum mechanical models of large filaments, which are based on worm-like chain models for polymers. Assemblies of actin filaments are connected with cross-linker proteins. Models with discrete filaments, so-called Mikado models, allow us to investigate the dependence of the properties of networks on the parameters of the constituents. Microstructurally motivated continuum models of the networks provide insights into larger systems containing cross-linked actin networks. Modeling of such systems helps to gain insight into the processes on such small scales. On the other hand, they call for verification and hence trigger the improvement of established experiments and the development of new methods.},

	Abstract = {The balance of actin filament polymerization and depolymerization maintains a steady state network treadmill in neuronal growth cones essential for motility and guidance. Here we have investigated the connection between depolymerization and treadmilling dynamics. We show that polymerization-competent barbed ends are concentrated at the leading edge and depolymerization is distributed throughout the peripheral domain. We found a high-to-low G-actin gradient between peripheral and central domains. Inhibiting turnover with jasplakinolide collapsed this gradient and lowered leading edge barbed end density. Ultrastructural analysis showed dramatic reduction of leading edge actin filament density and filament accumulation in central regions. Live cell imaging revealed that the leading edge retracted even as retrograde actin flow rate decreased exponentially. Inhibition of myosin II activity before jasplakinolide treatment lowered baseline retrograde flow rates and prevented leading edge retraction. Myosin II activity preferentially affected filopodial bundle disassembly distinct from the global effects of jasplakinolide on network turnover. We propose that growth cone retraction following turnover inhibition resulted from the persistence of myosin II contractility even as leading edge assembly rates decreased. The buildup of actin filaments in central regions combined with monomer depletion and reduced polymerization from barbed ends suggests a mechanism for the observed exponential decay in actin retrograde flow. Our results show that growth cone motility is critically dependent on continuous disassembly of the peripheral actin network.},

Here we study, using both numerical and analytical methods, organized motion in models of the cytoskeleton in which constituents are driven by energy-consuming motors. Although systems driven by small-step motors are described by an effective temperature and are thus quiescent, at higher order in step size, both homogeneous and inhomogeneous, flowing and oscillating behavior emerges. Motors that respond with a negative susceptibility to imposed forces lead to an apparent negative-temperature system in which beautiful structures form resembling the asters seen in cell division.},

Polymerization and the lifetime of actin filaments in lamellipodia were measured with high spatial precision. Basal polymerization and depolymerization occurred throughout lamellipodia with largely constant kinetics, and polymerization was promoted within one micron of the lamellipodium tip. Most of the actin filaments in the lamellipodium were generated by polymerization away from the tip.},

	Abstract = {Constituents of living or synthetic active matter have access to a local energy supply that serves to keep the system out of thermal equilibrium. The statistical properties of such fluctuating active systems differ from those of their equilibrium counterparts. Using the actin filament gliding assay as a model, we studied how nonthermal distributions emerge in active matter. We found that the basic mechanism involves the interplay between local and random injection of energy, acting as an analog of a thermal heat bath, and nonequilibrium energy dissipation processes associated with sudden jump-like changes in the system's dynamic variables. We show here how such a mechanism leads to a nonthermal distribution of filament curvatures with a non-Gaussian shape. The experimental curvature statistics and filament relaxation dynamics are reproduced quantitatively by stochastic computer simulations and a simple kinetic model.},

		abstract = {Differential cell adhesion has long been thought to drive cell sorting. Ma{\^\i}tre et al. (p. 253, published online 23 August) show that cell sorting in zebrafish gastrulation is triggered by differences in the ability of cells to modulate cortex tension at cell-cell contacts, thereby controlling contact expansion. Cell adhesion functions in this process by mechanically coupling the cortices of adhering cells at their contacts, allowing cortex tension to control contact expansion. In zebrafish epiboly the enveloping cell layer (EVL){\textemdash}a surface epithelium formed at the animal pole of the gastrula{\textemdash}gradually spreads over the entire yolk cell to engulf it at the end of gastrulation. Behrndt et al. (p. 257) show that an actomyosin ring connected to the epithelial margin triggers EVL spreading both by contracting around its circumference and by generating a pulling force through resistance against retrograde actomyosin flow.Contractile actomyosin rings drive various fundamental morphogenetic processes ranging from cytokinesis to wound healing. Actomyosin rings are generally thought to function by circumferential contraction. Here, we show that the spreading of the enveloping cell layer (EVL) over the yolk cell during zebrafish gastrulation is driven by a contractile actomyosin ring. In contrast to previous suggestions, we find that this ring functions not only by circumferential contraction but also by a flow-friction mechanism. This generates a pulling force through resistance against retrograde actomyosin flow. EVL spreading proceeds normally in situations where circumferential contraction is unproductive, indicating that the flow-friction mechanism is sufficient. Thus, actomyosin rings can function in epithelial morphogenesis through a combination of cable-constriction and flow-friction mechanisms.},

	abstract={Background: The assembly of an F-actin- and myosin-II-containing contractile ring (CR) is required for cytokinesis in eukaryotic cells. Interactions between myosin II and actin in the ring are believed to generate the force that constricts the cell into two daughters. The mechanism(s) that contribute to the spatially and temporally regulated assembly and disassembly of the CR at the cell equator are poorly understood.Results: We generated an LLCPK1 epithelial cell line that stably expresses GFP-actin. Live confocal imaging showed accumulation of GFP-actin in the equatorial cortex from late anaphase through cytokinesis. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments showed that actin in the CR is highly dynamic (t1/2 = 26 s). In some cells, movement of GFP-actin toward the equatorial region was observed and contributed to FRAP. Blocking actin dynamic turnover with jasplakinolide demonstrates that dynamic actin is required for CR formation and cytokinesis. To test the role of myosin II in actin turnover and transport during CR formation, we inhibited myosin light-chain kinase with ML7 and myosin II ATPase activity with blebbistatin. Inhibition of myosin light-chain phosphorylation resulted in clearance of GFP-actin from the equatorial region, a reduction in myosin II in the furrow, and inhibition of cytokinesis. Treatment with blebbistatin did not block CR formation but reduced FRAP of GFP-actin and prevented completion of cytokinesis.Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the majority of actin in the CR is highly dynamic and establish novel roles for myosin II in the retention and dynamic turnover of actin in the CR.},

	abstract={The involvement of myosin II in cytokinesis has been demonstrated with microinjection, genetic, and pharmacological approaches; however, the exact role of myosin II in cell division remains poorly understood. To address this question, we treated dividing normal rat kidney (NRK) cells with blebbistatin, a potent inhibitor of the nonmuscle myosin II ATPase. Blebbistatin caused a strong inhibition of cytokinesis but no detectable effect on the equatorial localization of actin or myosin. However, whereas these filaments dissociated from the equator in control cells during late cytokinesis, they persisted in blebbistatin-treated cells over an extended period of time. The accumulation of equatorial actin was caused by the inhibition of actin filament turnover, as suggested by a 2-fold increase in recovery half-time after fluorescence photobleaching. Local release of blebbistatin at the equator caused localized accumulation of equatorial actin and inhibition of cytokinesis, consistent with the function of myosin II along the furrow. However, treatment of the polar region also caused a high frequency of abnormal cytokinesis, suggesting that myosin II may play a second, global role. Our observations indicate that myosin II ATPase is not required for the assembly of equatorial cortex during cytokinesis but is essential for its subsequent turnover and remodeling.},
