% This is an example document for easychithesis, a 
% LaTeX2e style for formating theses at the University of
% Chicago.The easychithesis style was written by Bryan Clair and 
% Nathan Dunfield.  It contains detailed instructions for using
% easychithesis.
%
%  HINTS:
%
%  1. To get appendices, you don't do anything different from a normal
%     report document.  That means, put the command \appendix before
%     you begin your first appendix, then do each appendix with a
%     \chapter command.  Note that if you have only one appendix, it is
%     customary to leave it unnumbered.  Do this with \chapter*.
%
%  2.  If you use \chapter*, which produces unnumbered chapters, you 
%       have to add that chapter to the table of contents by hand, e.g.
%
%         \chapter*{Appendix}
%         \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Appendix}
%
%  3.  If you get errors about
%   
%    Undefined control sequence.
%         \setspace@size ...rrsize \normalsize \@normalsize \else \@currsize \fi 
%
%     You need a newer version of the file ``setspace.sty''.
%
%  4.  Problems with math formulas in chapter headings:
% 
%         a.  Any lowercase letters in the formula are converted to
%         uppercase, e.g. f(x) becomes F(X).   If you really need
%         lowercase math letters in your chapter titles, use the
%         option plainchapterheads (and, if you want, type your
%         chapter titles in ALL CAPS so that the appearance doesn't
%         change).  Note there is no problem 
%         for section or subsection headings in either case.  (Options
%         such as plainchapterheads are given as part of the 
%         \documentclass command, see below under ``Document Options'').
%
%         b.  Some perfectly reasonable math commands when used in
%         \chapter give the error
%          ``LATEX ERROR: \command  ALLOWED ONLY IN MATH MODE.''
%         The solution to this is to do
%        
%              \newcommand{\mymath}{problem math goes here}
%       
%         and then
%        
%              \chapter{All about \protect\mymath}
%
%         also, the option plainchapterheads will fix this too.
%
%  5. If your References section doesn't show up in the table of
%     contents, you need to add the line \addcontentsline...
%     as done at end of this file.   Make sure that you include the 
%     page break command as done there or else you may end up
%     with the wrong page number in your table of contents. 

\documentclass{easychithesis}
% Document Options: 
%
% Note if you want to save paper when printing drafts, replace the
% above line by
% 
%   \documentclass[singlespace]{easychithesis}
% 
% or 
% 
%   \documentclass[onehalfspace]{easychithesis}
%
% Also the ``double spacing'' provided by this style is not ``true''
% doublespacing as defined by setspace.sty.  Instead, it is the same
% as on the old LaTeX 2.09 thesis style ``chithesis''.  If you want 
% ``true'' doublespacing (if there is such a thing), give the option 
% truedoublespace.  The increase in tree murder will be on your 
% conscience, not mine.
%
%  Similarly, if you need to use the plainchapterheads option, you do
%   
%  \documentclass[plainchapterheads]{easychithesis}
%
% You can give more than one option, if you desire.

\topmatter{Abstract}
Actomyosin-based cortical flow is a fundamental engine for cellular morphogenesis.  Cortical flows are generated by cross-linked networks of actin filaments and myosin motors, in which active stress produced by motor activity is opposed by passive resistance to network deformation.  Continuous flow requires local remodeling through crosslink unbinding and and/or filament disassembly. But how local remodeling tunes stress production and dissipation, and how this in turn shapes long range flow, remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a computational model for a cross-linked networks with active motors based on minimal requirements for production and dissipation of contractile stress, namely asymmetric filament compliance, spatial heterogeneity of motor activity, reversible cross-links and filament turnover.  We characterize how the production and dissipation of network stress depend, individually, on cross-link dynamics and filament turnover, and how these dependencies combine to determine overall rates of cortical flow. Our analysis predicts that filament turnover is required to maintain active stress against external resistance and steady state flow in response to external stress. Steady state stress increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time $\tau_{m}$, then decreases with lifetime above $\tau_{m}$.   Effective viscosity increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time $\tau_c$, and then becomes independent of filament lifetime and sharply dependent on crosslink dynamics.  These individual dependencies of active stress and effective viscosity define multiple regimes of steady state flow.  In particular our model predicts the existence of a regime, when filament lifetimes are shorter than both $\tau_c$ and $\tau_{m}$, in which dependencies of effective viscosity and steady state stress cancel one another, such that flow speed is insensitive to filament turnover, and shows simple dependence on motor activity and crosslink dynamics.  These results provide a framework for understanding how animal cells tune cortical flow through local control of network remodeling.
