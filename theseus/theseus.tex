%
% This is an example document for easychithesis, a 
% LaTeX2e style for formating theses at the University of
% Chicago.The easychithesis style was written by Bryan Clair and 
% Nathan Dunfield.  It contains detailed instructions for using
% easychithesis.
%
%  HINTS:
%
%  1. To get appendices, you don't do anything different from a normal
%     report document.  That means, put the command \appendix before
%     you begin your first appendix, then do each appendix with a
%     \chapter command.  Note that if you have only one appendix, it is
%     customary to leave it unnumbered.  Do this with \chapter*.
%
%  2.  If you use \chapter*, which produces unnumbered chapters, you 
%       have to add that chapter to the table of contents by hand, e.g.
%
%         \chapter*{Appendix}
%         \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Appendix}
%
%  3.  If you get errors about
%   
%    Undefined control sequence.
%         \setspace@size ...rrsize \normalsize \@normalsize \else \@currsize \fi 
%
%     You need a newer version of the file ``setspace.sty''.
%
%  4.  Problems with math formulas in chapter headings:
% 
%         a.  Any lowercase letters in the formula are converted to
%         uppercase, e.g. f(x) becomes F(X).   If you really need
%         lowercase math letters in your chapter titles, use the
%         option plainchapterheads (and, if you want, type your
%         chapter titles in ALL CAPS so that the appearance doesn't
%         change).  Note there is no problem 
%         for section or subsection headings in either case.  (Options
%         such as plainchapterheads are given as part of the 
%         \documentclass command, see below under ``Document Options'').
%
%         b.  Some perfectly reasonable math commands when used in
%         \chapter give the error
%          ``LATEX ERROR: \command  ALLOWED ONLY IN MATH MODE.''
%         The solution to this is to do
%        
%              \newcommand{\mymath}{problem math goes here}
%       
%         and then
%        
%              \chapter{All about \protect\mymath}
%
%         also, the option plainchapterheads will fix this too.
%
%  5. If your References section doesn't show up in the table of
%     contents, you need to add the line \addcontentsline...
%     as done at end of this file.   Make sure that you include the 
%     page break command as done there or else you may end up
%     with the wrong page number in your table of contents. 

\documentclass{easychithesis}
% Document Options: 
%
% Note if you want to save paper when printing drafts, replace the
% above line by
% 
%   \documentclass[singlespace]{easychithesis}
% 
% or 
% 
%   \documentclass[onehalfspace]{easychithesis}
%
% Also the ``double spacing'' provided by this style is not ``true''
% doublespacing as defined by setspace.sty.  Instead, it is the same
% as on the old LaTeX 2.09 thesis style ``chithesis''.  If you want 
% ``true'' doublespacing (if there is such a thing), give the option 
% truedoublespace.  The increase in tree murder will be on your 
% conscience, not mine.
%
%  Similarly, if you need to use the plainchapterheads option, you do
%   
%  \documentclass[plainchapterheads]{easychithesis}
%
% You can give more than one option, if you desire.
