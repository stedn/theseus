@article{rheo_fluid2,
	Abstract = {Continuous deformation and entry flow of single blood granulocytes into small caliber micropipets at various suction pressures have been studied to determine an apparent viscosity for the cell contents and to estimate the extent that dissipation in a cortical layer adjacent to the cell surface contributes to the total viscous flow resistance. Experiments were carried out with a wide range of pipet sizes (2.0-7.5 microns) and suction pressures (10(2)-10(4) dyn/cm2) to examine the details of the entry flow. The results show that the outer cortex of the cell maintains a small persistent tension of approximately 0.035 dyn/cm. The tension creates a threshold pressure below which the cell will not enter the pipet. The superficial plasma membrane of these cells appears to establish an upper limit to surface dilation which is reached after microscopic "ruffles" and "folds" have been pulled smooth. With aspiration of cells by small pipets (less than 2.7 microns), the limit to surface expansion was derived from the maximal extension of the cell into the pipet; final areas were measured to be 2.1 to 2.2 times the area of the initial spherical shape. For suctions in excess of a threshold, the response to constant pressure was continuous flow in proportion to excess pressure above the threshold with only a small nonlinearity over time until the cell completely entered the pipet (for pipet calibers greater than 2.7 microns). With a theoretical model introduced in a companion paper, (Yeung, A., and E. Evans., 1989, Biophys. J. 56:139-149) the entry flow response versus pipet size and suction pressure was analyzed to estimate the apparent viscosity of the cell interior and the ratio of cortical flow resistance to flow resistance from the cell interior. The apparent viscosity was found to depend strongly on temperature with values on the order of 2 x 10(3) poise at 23 degrees C, lower values of 1 x 10(3) poise at 37 degrees C, but extremely large values in excess of 10(4) poise below 10 degrees C. Because of scatter in cell response, it was not possible to accurately establish the characteristic ratio for flow resistance in the cortex to that inside the cell; however, the data showed that the cortex does not contribute significantly to the total flow resistance.

	Abstract = {The mechanical behavior of living cells is studied with micropipette suction in which the surface of a cell is aspirated into a small glass tube while tracking the leading edge of its surface. Such edges can be tracked in a light microscope to an accuracy of $\pm$25&#xa0;nm and suction pressures as small as 0.1--0.2&#xa0;pN/μm2 can be imposed on the cell. Both soft cells, such as neutrophils and red cells, and more rigid cells, such as chondrocytes and endothelial cells, are studied with this technique. Interpretation of the measurements with basic continuum models leads to values for a cell's elastic and viscous properties. In particular, neutrophils are found to behave as a liquid drop with a cortical (surface) tension of about 30&#xa0;pN/μm and a viscosity on the order of 100&#xa0;Pa s. On the other hand, chondrocytes and endothelial cells behave as solids with an elastic modulus of the order of 500&#xa0;pN/μm2 (0.5&#xa0;kPa). },

	Abstract = {A concerted flow of actin filaments associated with the inner face of the plasma membrane may provide the basis for many animal cell movements. The flow is driven by gradients of tension in the cell cortex, which pull cortical components from regions of relaxation to regions of contraction. In some cases cortical components return through the cytoplasm to establish a continuous cycle. This cortically located motor may drive cell locomotion, growth cone migration, the capping of antigens on a lymphocyte surface, and cytokinesis.},

@article{cellmech_flows2,
	Abstract = {We have examined the cortex of Caenorhabditis elegans eggs during pseudocleavage (PC), a period of the first cell cycle which is important for the generation of asymmetry at first cleavage (Strome, S. 1989. Int. Rev. Cytol. 114: 81-123). We have found that directed, actin dependent, cytoplasmic, and cortical flow occurs during this period coincident with a rearrangement of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (Strome, S. 1986. J. Cell Biol. 103: 2241-2252). The flow velocity (4-7 microns/min) is similar to previously determined particle movements driven by cortical actin flows in motile cells. We show that directed flows occur in one of the daughters of the first division that itself divides asymmetrically, but not in its sister that divides symmetrically. The cortical and cytoplasmic events of PC can be mimicked in other cells during cytokinesis by displacing the mitotic apparatus with the microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole. In all cases, the polarity of the resulting cortical and cytoplasmic flows correlates with the position of the attenuated mitotic spindle formed. These cortical flows are also accompanied by a change in the distribution of the cortical actin network. The polarity of this redistribution is similarly correlated with the location of the attenuated spindle. These observations suggest a mechanism for generating polarized flows of cytoplasmic and cortical material during embryonic cleavages. We present a model for the events of PC and suggest how the poles of the mitotic spindle mediate the formation of the contractile ring during cytokinesis in C. elegans.},

	Abstract = {{This book provides a comprehensive account of the modern theory for the dynamical properties of polymer solutions. The theory has undergone dramatic evolution over the last two decades due to the introduction of new methods and concepts that have extended the frontier of theory from dilute<br>solutions in which polymers move independently to concentrated solutions where many polymers converge. Among the properties examined are viscoelasticity, diffusion, dynamic light scattering, and electric birefringence. Nonlinear viscoelasticity is discussed in detail on the basis of molecular<br>dynamical models. The book bridges the gap between classical theory and new developments, creating a consistent picture of polymer solution dynamics over the entire concentration range.}},

@article{rheo_review,
	Abstract = { The cytoskeleton is the primary internal structure of the cell, providing its structural integrity. The rheology and mechanics of the cytoskeleton, therefore, are key to the cell's ability to accomplish its diverse functions in health and disease. Although the importance of the cytoskeleton is well established, the relationship between the microstructural details and the macroscopic rheological behavior of the cytoskeleton remains elusive. A wide range of computational and phenomenological models as well as experimental techniques have been proposed over the past two decades to describe the cytoskeleton, giving rise to several, often contradictory, theories for describing its rheology. This concise review attempts to bring together the key experimental methods and theoretical and computational models regarding cytoskeletal rheology and mechanics. },

@article{rheo_active,
	Abstract = {We describe an active polymer network in which processive molecular motors control network elasticity. This system consists of actin filaments cross-linked by filamin A (FLNa) and contracted by bipolar filaments of muscle myosin II. The myosin motors stiffen the network by more than two orders of magnitude by pulling on actin filaments anchored in the network by FLNa cross-links, thereby generating internal stress. The stiffening response closely mimics the effects of external stress applied by mechanical shear. Both internal and external stresses can drive the network into a highly nonlinear, stiffened regime. The active stress reaches values that are equivalent to an external stress of 14 Pa, consistent with a 1-pN force per myosin head. This active network mimics many mechanical properties of cells and suggests that adherent cells exert mechanical control by operating in a nonlinear regime where cell stiffness is sensitive to changes in motor activity. This design principle may be applicable to engineering novel biologically inspired, active materials that adjust their own stiffness by internal catalytic control.},

@article{model_review,
	Abstract = {This review summarizes the models that researchers use to represent the conformations and dynamics of cytoskeletal and DNA filaments. It focuses on models that address individual filaments in continuous space. Conformation models include the freely jointed, Gaussian, angle-biased chain (ABC), and wormlike chain (WLC) models, of which the first three bend at discrete joints and the last bends continuously. Predictions from the WLC model generally agree well with experiment. Dynamics models include the Rouse, Zimm, stiff rod, dynamic WLC, and reptation models, of which the first four apply to isolated filaments and the last to entangled filaments. Experiments show that the dynamic WLC and reptation models are most accurate. They also show that biological filaments typically experience strong hydrodynamic coupling and/or constrained motion. Computer simulation methods that address filament dynamics typically compute filament segment velocities from local forces using the Langevin equation and then integrate these velocities with explicit or implicit methods; the former are more versatile and the latter are more efficient. Much remains to be discovered in biological filament modeling. In particular, filament dynamics in living cells are not well understood, and current computational methods are too slow and not sufficiently versatile. Although primarily a review, this paper also presents new statistical calculations for the ABC and WLC models. Additionally, it corrects several discrepancies in the literature about bending and torsional persistence length definitions, and their relations to flexural and torsional rigidities.},

@article{rheo_2D1,
	Abstract = {Here we develop a minimal model of the cell actomyosin cortex by forming a quasi-2D cross-linked filamentous actin (F-actin) network adhered to a model cell membrane and contracted by myosin thick filaments. Myosin motors generate both compressive and tensile stresses on F-actin and consequently induce large bending fluctuations, which reduces their effective persistence length to <1 μm. Over a large range of conditions, we show the extent of network contraction corresponds exactly to the extent of individual F-actin shortening via buckling. This demonstrates an essential role of buckling in breaking the symmetry between tensile and compressive stresses to facilitate mesoscale network contraction of up to 80% strain. Portions of buckled F-actin with a radius of curvature ∼300 nm are prone to severing and thus compressive stresses mechanically coordinate contractility with F-actin severing, the initial step of F-actin turnover. Finally, the F-actin curvature acquired by myosin-induced stresses can be further constrained by adhesion of the network to a membrane, accelerating filament severing but inhibiting the long-range transmission of the stresses necessary for network contractility. Thus, the extent of membrane adhesion can regulate the coupling between network contraction and F-actin severing. These data demonstrate the essential role of the nonlinear response of F-actin to compressive stresses in potentiating both myosin-mediated contractility and filament severing. This may serve as a general mechanism to mechanically coordinate contractility and cortical dynamics across diverse actomyosin assemblies in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells.},

	Abstract = {We show that actin filaments, shortened to physiological lengths by gelsolin and cross-linked with recombinant human filamins (FLNs), exhibit dynamic elastic properties similar to those reported for live cells. To achieve elasticity values of comparable magnitude to those of cells, the in vitro network must be subjected to external prestress, which directly controls network elasticity. A molecular requirement for the strain-related behavior at physiological conditionsis a flexible hinge found in FLNa and some FLNb molecules. Basic physical properties of the in vitro filamin--F-actin network replicate the essential mechanical properties of living cells. This physical behavior could accommodate passive deformation and internal organelle trafficking at low strains yet resist externally or internally generated high shear forces.},

	Abstract = {A magnetic bead microrheometer has been designed which allows the generation of forces up to 104&#xa0;pN on 4.5&#xa0;μm paramagnetic beads. It is applied to measure local viscoelastic properties of the surface of adhering fibroblasts. Creep response and relaxation curves evoked by tangential force pulses of 500-2500&#xa0;pN (and ∼1&#xa0;s duration) on the magnetic beads fixed to the integrin receptors of the cell membrane are recorded by particle tracking. Linear three-phasic creep responses consisting of an elastic deflection, a stress relaxation, and a viscous flow are established. The viscoelastic response curves are analyzed in terms of a series arrangement of a dashpot and a Voigt body, which allows characterization of the viscoelastic behavior of the adhering cell surface in terms of three parameters: an effective elastic constant, a viscosity, and a relaxation time. The displacement field generated by the local tangential forces on the cell surface is visualized by observing the induced motion of assemblies of nonmagnetic colloidal probes fixed to the membrane. It is found that the displacement field decays rapidly with the distance from the magnetic bead. A cutoff radius of Rc&#xa0;∼&#xa0;7&#xa0;μm of the screened elastic field is established. Partial penetration of the shear field into the cytoplasm is established by observing the induced deflection of intracellular compartments. The cell membrane was modeled as a thin elastic plate of shear modulus μ* coupled to a viscoelastic layer, which is fixed to a solid support on the opposite side; the former accounts for the membrane/actin cortex, and the latter for the contribution of the cytoskeleton to the deformation of the cell envelope. It is characterized by the coupling constant χ characterizing the elasticity of the cytoskeleton. The coupling constant χ and the surface shear modulus μ* are obtained from the measured displacements of the magnetic and nonmagnetic beads. By analyzing the experimental data in terms of this model a surface shear modulus of μ*&#xa0;≈&#xa0;2 · 10−3&#xa0;Pa m to 4 · 10−3&#xa0;Pa m is found. By assuming an approximate plate thickness of 0.1&#xa0;μm one estimates an average bulk shear modulus of μ&#xa0;≈&#xa0;(2 ÷ 4) · 10−4&#xa0;Pa, which is in reasonable agreement with data obtained by atomic force microscopy. The viscosity of the dashpot is related to the apparent viscosity of the cytoplasm, which is obtained by assuming that the top membrane is coupled to the bottom (fixed) membrane by a viscous medium. By application of the theory of diffusion of membrane proteins in supported membranes we find a coefficient of friction of bc&#xa0;≈&#xa0;2 · 109&#xa0;Pa s/m corresponding to a cytoplasmic viscosity of 2 · 103&#xa0;Pa s. },

	Abstract = {Intermediate filament networks in the cytoplasm and nucleus are critical for the mechanical integrity of metazoan cells. However, the mechanism of crosslinking in these networks and the origins of their mechanical properties are not understood. Here, we study the elastic behavior of in vitro networks of the intermediate filament protein vimentin. Rheological experiments reveal that vimentin networks stiffen with increasing concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+, showing that divalent cations act as crosslinkers. We quantitatively describe the elastic response of vimentin networks over five decades of applied stress using a theory that treats the divalent cations as crosslinkers: at low stress, the behavior is entropic in origin, and increasing stress pulls out thermal fluctuations from single filaments, giving rise to a nonlinear response; at high stress, enthalpic stretching of individual filaments significantly modifies the nonlinearity. We investigate the elastic properties of networks formed by a series of protein variants with stepwise tail truncations and find that the last 11 amino acids of the C-terminal tail domain mediate crosslinking by divalent ions. We determined the single-filament persistence length, lP&#xa0;≈&#xa0;0.5 μm, and Young's modulus, Y&#xa0;≈&#xa0;9 MPa; both are consistent with literature values. Our results provide insight into a crosslinking mechanism for vimentin networks and suggest that divalent ions may help regulate the cytoskeletal structure and mechanical properties of cells. },

	Abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton{,} a network of protein-polymers{,} is responsible for the mechanical stability of cells. This biopolymer network is also crucial for processes that require spatial and temporal variations in the network structure such as cell migration{,} division and intracellular transport. The cytoskeleton therefore has to combine structural integrity and mechanical stability with the possibility of fast and efficient network reorganization and restructuring. Cells meet this challenge by using proteins to link filamentous actin (F-actin) and construct complex networks. The molecular properties of the cross-linking proteins determine to a large extent the (micro)structure{,} viscoelastic properties and dynamics of the resulting networks. This review focuses on the structural polymorphism that can be induced by cross-linking proteins in reconstituted F-actin networks and summarizes recent results on how the molecular properties of cross-linking proteins dictate the ensuing viscoelastic properties.},

	Abstract = {The cortex is a thin, crosslinked actin network lying immediately beneath the plasma membrane of animal cells. Myosin motors exert contractile forces in the meshwork. Because the cortex is attached to the cell membrane, it plays a central role in cell shape control. The proteic constituents of the cortex undergo rapid turnover, making the cortex both mechanically rigid and highly plastic, two properties essential to its function. The cortex has recently attracted increasing attention and its functions in cellular processes such as cytokinesis, cell migration, and embryogenesis are progressively being dissected. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the structural organization, composition, and mechanics of the actin cortex, focusing on the link between molecular processes and macroscopic physical properties. We also highlight consequences of cortex dysfunction in disease. },

	Abstract = {Self-assembly of complex structures is commonplace in biology but often poorly understood. In the case of the actin cytoskeleton, a great deal is known about the components that include higher order structures, such as lamellar meshes, filopodial bundles, and stress fibers. Each of these cytoskeletal structures contains actin filaments and cross-linking proteins, but the role of cross-linking proteins in the initial steps of structure formation has not been clearly elucidated. We employ an optical trapping assay to investigate the behaviors of two actin cross-linking proteins, fascin and α-actinin, during the first steps of structure assembly. Here, we show that these proteins have distinct binding characteristics that cause them to recognize and cross-link filaments that are arranged with specific geometries. α-Actinin is a promiscuous cross-linker, linking filaments over all angles. It retains this flexibility after cross-links are formed, maintaining a connection even when the link is rotated. Conversely, fascin is extremely selective, only cross-linking filaments in a parallel orientation. Surprisingly, bundles formed by either protein are extremely stable, persisting for over 0.5 h in a continuous wash. However, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence decay experiments, we find that the stable fascin population can be rapidly competed away by free fascin. We present a simple avidity model for this cross-link dissociation behavior. Together, these results place constraints on how cytoskeletal structures assemble, organize, and disassemble in vivo.},

@article{mol_crosslinkfilamin,
	Abstract = {Rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is integral to cell shape and function. Actin-binding proteins, e.g., filamin, can naturally contribute to the mechanics and function of the actin cytoskeleton. The molecular mechanical bases for filamin's function in actin cytoskeletal reorganization are examined here using molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations are performed by applying forces ranging from 25&#xa0;pN to 125&#xa0;pN for 2.5&#xa0;ns to the rod domain of filamin. Applying small loads (∼25&#xa0;pN) to filamin's rod domain supplies sufficient energy to alter the conformation of the N-terminal regions of the rod. These forces break local hydrogen bond coordination often enough to allow side chains to find new coordination partners, in turn leading to drastic changes in the conformation of filamin, for example, increasing the hydrophobic character of the N-terminal rod region and, alternatively, activating the C-terminal region to become increasingly stiff. These changes in conformation can lead to changes in the affinity of filamin for its binding partners. Therefore, filamin can function to transduce mechanical signals as well as preserve topology of the actin cytoskeleton throughout the rod domain. },

@article{mol_crosslinkHMM,
	Abstract = {Load dependence of the lifetime of the rigor bonds formed between a single myosin molecule (either heavy meromyosin, HMM, or myosin subfragment-1, S1) and actin filament was examined in the absence of nucleotide by pulling the barbed end of the actin filament with optical tweezers. For S1, the relationship between the lifetime (τ) and the externally imposed load (F) at absolute temperature T could be expressed as τ(F)&#xa0;=&#xa0;τ(0)·exp(−F·d/kBT) with τ(0) of 67&#xa0;s and an apparent interaction distance d of 2.4&#xa0;nm (kB is the Boltzmann constant). The relationship for \{HMM\} was expressed by the sum of two exponentials, with two sets of τ(0) and d being, respectively, 62&#xa0;s and 2.7&#xa0;nm, and 950&#xa0;s and 1.4&#xa0;nm. The fast component of \{HMM\} coincides with τ(F) for S1, suggesting that the fast component corresponds to single-headed binding and the slow component to double-headed binding. These large interaction distances, which may be a common characteristic of motor proteins, are attributed to the geometry for applying an external load. The pulling experiment has also allowed direct estimation of the number of myosin molecules interacting with an actin filament. Actin filaments tethered to a single \{HMM\} molecule underwent extensive rotational Brownian motion, indicating a low torsional stiffness for HMM. From these results, we discuss the characteristics of interaction between actin and myosin, with the focus on the manner of binding of myosin. },

@article{mol_actinextension,
	Abstract = {In this report we characterized the longitudinal elasticity of single actin filaments manipulated by novel silicon-nitride microfabricated levers. Single actin filaments were stretched from zero tension to maximal physiological tension, P0. The obtained length-tension relation was nonlinear in the low-tension range (0--50 pN) with a resultant strain of ∼0.4--0.6% and then became linear at moderate to high tensions (∼50--230 pN). In this region, the stretching stiffness of a single rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled, 1-μm-long F-actin is 34.5&#xa0;$\pm$&#xa0;3.5 pN/nm. Such a length-tension relation could be characterized by an entropic-enthalpic worm-like chain model, which ascribes most of the energy consumed in the nonlinear portion to overcoming thermal undulations arising from the filament's interaction with surrounding solution and the linear portion to the intrinsic stretching elasticity. By fitting the experimental data with such a worm-like chain model, an estimation of persistence length of ∼8.75&#xa0;μm was derived. These results suggest that F-actin is more compliant than previously thought and that thin filament compliance may account for a substantial fraction of the sarcomere's elasticity. },

@article{theo_hydroish1,
	Abstract = {Numerical simulation is used to investigate the flow of polymer solutions around a periodic, linear array of cylinders by using three constitutive equations derived from kinetic theory of dilute polymer solutions: the Giesekus model; the finitely extensible, nonlinear elastic dumbbell model with Peterlin's approximation (FENE-P); and the \{FENE\} dumbbell model of Chilcott--Rallison (CR). In the Giesekus model, intramolecular forces are described by a Hookean spring, whereas a finitely extensible spring whose modulus is given by the Warner approximation is used in both the FENE-P and \{CR\} models. Hydro dynamic drag on the beads is taken to be anisotropic for the Giesekus model and isotropic for the other two models. The \{CR\} and FENE-P models differ subtly in their approximate treatment of the nonlinear force law. The three models exhibit very similar rheological behavior in viscometric flow and steady elongational flow, with the notable exception that the viscosity for the \{CR\} model is shear-rate independent. Finite element simulations are performed by using two different formulations: the elastic-viscous split-stress gradient (EVSS-G) method and a new variant of this formulation, the discrete EVSS-G (DEVSS-G) formulation, in which the elliptic stabilization term is added only to the discrete version of the momentum equation, and the constitutive equation is solved directly in terms of the polymer contribution to the stress tensor. Calculations are performed for all models up to a Weissenberg number We, where the configuration tensor 〈QQ〉 loses positive definiteness. However, by locally refining the mesh in the gap region, the positive definiteness of 〈QQ〉 is recovered. The flow and stress fields predicted by the three constitutive equations are qualitatively similar. A `birefringent strand' of highly stretched polymer molecules, which appears to emanate from the rear stagnation point in the cylinder, strengthens as We is increased. Not surprisingly, the molecular extension computed for the Giesekus model is considerably larger than that of the two \{FENE\} spring models. The drag force on the cylinders differs for the FENE-P and \{CR\} models, because of the difference in the shear-thinning viscosity resulting from the different approximations used in these models. },

@article{model_massive,
	Abstract = {The mechanics of biological tissue is largely determined by the mechanics of biopolymer networks such as the extracellular matrix on cellular scale or the cytoskeleton on subcellular scale. Micromechanical simulations of biopolymer networks have thus attracted increasing interest in the last years. Here we introduce a simulation framework for biopolymer networks based on a finite element model of the filaments with a backward Euler time integration scheme. This approach surpasses previously published ones, especially those based on bead-spring models, by its sound theoretical foundation, a great flexibility, and at the same time an efficiency gain of approximately two orders of magnitude. Thereby it allows for addressing problems no previous numerical method could deal with, e.g., the micromechanical analysis of the viscoelastic moduli of crosslinked biopolymer networks in the low frequency regime or the analysis of the thermal equilibrium phases of such networks. By means of several examples it is discussed how this capacity can be exploited in multiscale simulations of biological tissue on cellular and subcellular scale. },

@article{rheo_crosslinkcompare,
	Abstract = {The actin cross-linker α-actinin-4 has been found to be indispensable for the structural and functional integrity of podocytes; deficiency or alteration of this protein due to mutations results in kidney disease. To gain insight into the effect of the cross-linker on cytoskeletal mechanics, we studied the macroscopic rheological properties of actin networks cross-linked with wild-type and mutant α-actinin-4. The frequency-dependent viscoelasticity of the networks is characterized by an elastic plateau at intermediate frequencies, and relaxation toward fluid properties at low frequencies. The relaxation frequencies of networks with mutant α-actinin-4 are an order of magnitude lower than that with the wild-type, suggesting a slower reaction rate for the dissociation of actin and α-actinin for the mutant, consistent with a smaller observed equilibrium dissociation constant. This difference can be attributed to an additional binding site that is exposed as a result of the mutation, and can be interpreted as a difference in binding energy barriers. This is further supported by the Arrhenius-like temperature dependence of the relaxation frequencies. },

	Abstract = { Linear rheological properties of tightly-entangled isotropic solutions of semi-flexible polymers are calculated using a tube model, and qualitative predictions are given for the response of more dilute solutions. The linear complex modulus of a solution of long, tightly-entangled chains is dominated at low frequencies by a curvature contribution, analogous to the elastic stress of entangled flexible chains, that relaxes by reptation and gives rise to a broad elastic plateau. The modulus is dominated at higher frequencies by a larger tension contribution, whose frequency dependence is controlled at intermediate frequencies by the diffusion of excess length along the tube and at very high frequencies by the unhindered transverse motion of the chain within the tube. This high-frequency regime yields a complex modulus that varies as G*(ω) ∝ (iω)3/4 with frequency ω. Solutions of shorter, rod-like chains also exhibit a slowly-decaying orientational contribution analogous to the elastic stress found in solutions of true rigid rods. The linear response of the flow birefringence and the effect of cross-links between chains are also discussed. },

	Abstract = {To evaluate the contributions of cross-linker dynamics and polymer deformation to the frequency-dependent stiffness of actin filament gels, we compared the rheological properties of actin gels with three types of cross-linkers: a weak one, Acanthamoeba alpha-actinin (dissociation rate constant 5.2 s-1, association rate constant 1.1 x 10(6) M-1 s-1); a strong one, chicken smooth muscle alpha-actinin (dissociation rate constant 0.66 s-1, association rate constant 1.20 x 10(6) M-1 s-1); and an extremely strong one, biotin/avidin (dissociation rate constant approximately zero). The biotin/avidin cross-linked gel, whose behavior is determined by polymer bending alone, behaves like a solid and shows no frequency dependence. The amoeba alpha-actinin cross-linked gel behaves like a viscoelastic fluid, and the frequency dependence of the stiffness can be explained by a mathematical model for dynamically cross-linked gels. The stiffness of the chicken alpha-actinin cross-linked gel is independent of frequency, and has viscoelastic properties intermediate between the two. The two alpha-actinins have similar association rate constants for binding to actin filaments, consistent with a diffusion-limited reaction. Rigid cross-links make the gel stiff, but make it elastic without the ability to deform permanently. Dynamically cross-linked actin filaments should allow the cell to react passively to various outside forces without any sort of signaling. Slower, signal-mediated pathways, such as severing filaments or changing the affinity of cross-linkers, could alter the nature of these passive reactions. },

	Abstract = {Although the structure of cross-linking molecules mainly determines the structural organization of actin filaments and with that the static elastic properties of the cytoskeleton, it is largely unknown how the biochemical characteristics of transiently cross-linking proteins (actin-binding proteins (ABPs)) affect the viscoelasticity of actin networks. In this study, we show that the macroscopic network response of reconstituted actin networks can be traced back to the microscopic interaction potential of an individual actin/ABP bond. The viscoelastic response of cross-linked actin networks is set by the cross-linker off-rate, the binding energy, and the characteristic bond length of individual actin/ABP interactions.},

@article{rheo_crosslinkslip3,
	Abstract = {Filamentous actin and associated actin binding proteins play an essential role in governing the mechanical properties of eukaryotic cells. They can also play a critical role in disease; for example, mutations in α-actinin-4 (Actn4), a dynamic actin cross-linking protein, cause proteinuric disease in humans and mice. Amino acid substitutions strongly affect the binding affinity and protein structure of Actn4. To study the physical impact of such substitutions on the underlying cytoskeletal network, we examine the bulk mechanical behavior of in vitro actin networks cross-linked with wild-type and mutant Actn4. These networks exhibit a complex viscoelastic response and are characterized by fluid-like behavior at the longest timescales, a feature that can be quantitatively accounted for through a model governed by dynamic cross-linking. The elastic behavior of the network is highly nonlinear, becoming much stiffer with applied stress. This nonlinear elastic response is also highly sensitive to the mutations of Actn4. In particular, we observe that actin networks cross-linked with Actn4 bearing the disease-causing \{K255E\} mutation are more brittle, with a lower breaking stress in comparison to networks cross-linked with wild-type Actn4. Furthermore, a mutation that ablates the first actin binding site (ABS1) in Actn4 abrogates the network's ability to stress-stiffen is standard nomenclature. These changes in the mechanical properties of actin networks cross-linked with mutant Actn4 may represent physical determinants of the underlying disease mechanism in inherited focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. },

	Abstract = {We develop a computational model to compare the relative importance of unbinding and unfolding of actin cross-linking proteins (ACPs) in the dynamic properties of the actin cytoskeleton. We show that in the strain-stiffening regime with typical physiological and experimental strain rates, unbinding events are predominant with negligible unfolding. ACPs unbound by greater forces experience larger displacements, with a tendency to rebind to different filaments. At constant strain, stress relaxes to physiological levels by unbinding only---not unfolding---of ACPs, which is consistent with experiments. Also, rebinding of ACPs dampens full relaxation of stress. When the network is allowed to return to a stress-free state after shear deformation, plastic deformation is observed only with unbinding. These results suggest that despite the possibility of unfolding, unbinding of ACPs is the major determinant for the rheology of the actin network.},

	Abstract = {Slide-ring (SR) gels are polymer networks with movable cross-links that are prepared by cross-linking polyrotaxane (PR) in which many cyclic molecules are threaded into a linear polymer chain. The elastic modulus E of SR gels shows a unique dependence on cross-linking density: at a high cross-linking density{,} E decreases with increasing cross-linking density. This tendency is not in agreement with conventional rubber elasticity theory. In order to explain this abnormal dependence{,} we propose a novel molecular theory for SR gels{,} which considers the alignment entropy of cyclic molecules on polymer networks. The alignment yields new entropic elasticity of the slidable network in SR gels.},
