\section{Biological Context of Cortical Flow}
Cortical flow is a fundamental and ubiquitous form of cellular deformation that underlies cell polarization, cell division, cell crawling and multicellular tissue morphogenesis\cite{cellmech_flows3,cellmech_flows2,Benink:2000aa,Wilson:2010aa,Rauzi2010,Munro2004413}. Cortical flow has been recognized in a wide variety of contexts and is suspected to be a conserved mechanism by which many cell types in many organism can accomplish global pattern formation and mechanical force transduction, essential functions which are absolutely necessary of the survival of complex organisms.  In an early work chronicling the process of cortical flow in animal cells\cite{cellmech_flows3}, Bray and White proposed presciently that ``The flow is driven by gradients of tension in the cell cortex, which pull cortical components from regions of relaxation to regions of contraction... may drive cell locomotion, growth cone migration, the capping of antigens on a lymphocyte surface, and cytokinesis.''  In \cite{Munro2004413}, cortical flow was implicated as an important driver of the polarization of a single-cell embryo as a precursor to downstream cell specialization.  As you no doubt have heard before, in this system an initial asymmetry from the entry of a sperm into the nascent posterior pole of the embryo, gives rise to an initially small gradient in an upstream regulator of myosin contractility. From this small asymmetry flows begin which continue to drive cortical material from the posterior to anterior ends.   This process was later shown in \cite{cellmech_flows} to rely on gradients of tension as suggested in \cite{cellmech_flows3}. In \cite{Yumura200}, cortical flow was found to be driving amoeboid migration in \textit{Dictyostelium}. The flow of material is coupled to amoeba's surrounding by external adhesions, coupling the mechanical forces to the substrate and producing migration. Finally, a study by \cite{Behrndt257} investigating epithelial spreading during zebrafish epiboly has found that cortical flow can even give rise to shape changes in entire tissues.  In all these examples if the cell lacked the ability to carry out these long range persistent flows of material, it wouldn't be able to carry out its basic functions.  Despite the disparate functions,  the underlying mechanism is the same, and given the wide range of behaviors that rely on this core mechanism, it seems highly valuable to understand the underlying physical mechanism that accomplishes these tasks.


These flows originate within a thin layer of cross-linked actin filaments and myosin motors, called the actomyosin cortex, that lies just beneath the plasma membrane \cite{Salbreux2012536}.  Decades of research has taught us a great deal about the physical apparatus within the cell that sets up and drives these flows.  The machinery of cortical flow is the cortical actomyosin cytoskeleton, a meshwork of fiber-like actin filaments, bound together by smaller cross-links which bind and unbind to filaments holding them into a connected network.  This network serves to provide structural support to the cell, as well as generate and transduce mechanical force to carry out tasks like cellular shape change and migration. In different cells the actin cortex can take on different shapes and can have higher order structure. For example, the actin network can form branched networks as it does in the lammelipod of a migrating cell or it can form more tightly packed stress fibers as it does in the .  In muscle, actin and myosin have evolved from their original role in shaping the structure of the cell to drive even larger scale motion coordinated on the scale of a whole organism. Muscle cells are arranged such that the actin and myosin form linear arrays, which can contract in a single direction. However, the simplest and most widely applicable structure that is present in the external cortical layer of the majority of animal cells is that of the randomly oriented linear filament network packed together at a more or less uniform density.

These dense meshwork of actin filaments are not just tangled together. The filaments are tethered together by smaller cross-linking proteins \cite{B912163N}.  In cytoskeletal networks there can be many types of filament cross-linkers which physically bind actin filaments together. As two examples, filamin is a cross-linker known to bind actin together in loose disorganized networks while alpha-actinin binds into tighter bundles \cite{B912163N}.   Many of these cross-linkers also function in specific ways in specific locations to carry out different task around the cell.  For example, fascin is the main cross-linking protein found in filopodia, where it arranges filaments into aligned bundles with the same polarity \cite{Ross2000658}.



Interspersed, among the actin filaments are myosin motors which not only bind together and connect multiple filaments, but also exert local forces on the actin \cite{Dasanayake2013}.  Individual myosin motors polymerize together into bundles of molecular motors called myosin mini-filaments \cite{Dasanayake2013}. These mini-filaments can interact with multiple actins in the network to exert forces onto the actin filament network \cite{Bing2000}.  The activity of the motors then exerts force on the filament as those motors attempt to essentially walk in a certain direction along the filament \cite{Bing2000}.


Local forces produced by bipolar myosin filaments are integrated within cross-linked networks to build macroscopic contractile stress\cite{Murrell:2015aa,Bendix20083126,Janson1005}.  At the same time, cross-linked networks resist deformation and this resistance must be dissipated by network remodeling to allow macroscopic deformation and flow. 

Stress relaxation and deformation of filament networks is thought to occur due to the rearrangement of actin allowed by transient bindind and unbinding of cross-linkers\cite{Ahmed26052015}.  This process has also been shown to explain the dissipation of force in cross-linked networks \textit{in vitro} \cite{PhysRevLett.101.108101}.  To get a better understanding of  one can imagine just two filaments that are bound together with a couple of cross-linkers at their location of overlap along them.  If a force were applied to one of the filaments,  The cross-linkers would stretch out to sustain the force between the filaments.  But if one of those cross linkers was to unbind, then the filaments would be free to slide away from each other by a small amount.  Then another cross-linker could come in and bind, and the process could be repeated over and over allowing these filaments to slip past one another, dissipating stress and allowing for large scale deformation.  In this way, the transience of filament binding can allow for small scale deformations to persist.


Nevertheless, how force production and dissipation depend on motor activity and network remodeling remains poorly understood.  While it is clear from  \cite{cellmech_flows} that myosin force generation is crucial for driving flows, the exact mechanism by which actin and mysoin can generate force in two dimensions is only beginning to be elaborated in detail\cite{PhysRevX.4.041002}.  Therefore, it is unclear whether we fully understand the mechanism by which force is generated to drive cortical flows.  Moreover, rheological studies of stress relaxation in actin filament networks, suggest that filament remodeling is not sufficient to simultaneously relax and transmit stress at the rates observed in cells\cite{De-La-Cruz:2015aa}.  More recent work \cite{Kim2014526} has begun to suggest that dynamic filament turnover may be necessary for relaxing stress on the timescales observed in cells.  All of these issues lead to the conclusion that there is still more to be learned about the exact nature of cortical flow in cells.

Recent work has also begun to reveal mechanisms for active stress generation in disordered actomyosin networks. Theoretical studies suggest that spatial heterogeneity in motor activity along individual filaments, and asymmetrical filament compliance (stiffer in extension than in compression), are sufficient for macroscopic contraction \cite{1367-2630-14-3-033037,PhysRevX.4.041002}, although other routes to contractility may also exist \cite{PhysRevX.4.041002}.  Local interactions among actin filaments and myosin motors are sufficient to drive macroscopic contraction of disordered networks {\em in vitro} \cite{rheo_2D1}, and the kinematics of contraction observed in these studies support a mechanism based on asymmetrical filament compliance and filament buckling.  However, in these studies, the filaments were preassembled and network contraction was transient, because of irreversible network collapse\cite{Alvarado:2013aa}, or buildup of elastic resistance\cite{Murrell15062014}, or because network rearrangements (polarity sorting) dissipate the potential to generate contractile force \cite{Ennomani2016616,Reymann1310,Ndlec:1997aa,Surrey1167}. This suggests that network turnover may play essential role(s) in allowing sustained production of contractile force. Recent theoretical and modeling studies have begun to explore how this might work \cite{2015arXiv150706182H,Mak:2016aa,10.1371/journal.pone.0000696}, and to explore dynamic behaviors that can emerge when contractile material undergoes turnover \cite{PhysRevLett.103.058102,PhysRevLett.113.148102}. However, it remains a challenge to understand how force production and dissipation depend individually on the local interplay of network architecture, motor activity and filament turnover, and how these dependencies combine to mediate tunable control of long range cortical flow. 

Studies in living cells reveal fluid-like stress relaxation on timescales of 10-100s \cite{cellmech_flows,cellmech_flows2,cellmech_flows3,rheo_fluid,rheo_fluid2,cell_rheo_exp}, which is thought to arise through a combination of cross link unbinding and actin filament turnover \cite{De-La-Cruz:2015aa,De-La-Cruz:2009aa,Salbreux2012536}.  Theoretical \cite{theo_crosslinkslip1,theo_crosslinkslip2} and computational \cite{model_taeyoon,rheo_crosslinkslip2,theo_crosslinkslip3} studies reveal that cross-link unbinding can endow actin networks with complex time-dependent viscoelasticity. However, while cross-link unbinding is sufficient for viscous relaxation (creep) on very long timescales {\em in vitro}, it is unlikely to account for the rapid cortical deformation and flow observed in living cells \cite{rheo_crosslinksmatter,rheo_crosslinkslip1,rheo_crosslinkslip2,rheo_crosslinkslip3,rheo_nonaffine}.  Experimental studies in living cells reveal rapid turnover of cortical actin filaments on timescales comparable to stress relaxation (10-100s) \cite{Robin:2014aa,Fritzsche:2013aa,Fritzschee1501337,Carlsson:2010aa,Lai:2008aa}.  Perturbing turnover can lead to changes in cortical mechanics and in the rates and patterns of cortical flow\cite{Van-Goor:2012aa,Fritzschee1501337}.  However, the specific contributions of actin turnover to stress relaxation and how these depend on network architecture remain unclear.  








\section{Active fluid models of pattern formation and cortical flow}
One successful approach to modeling cortical flow has relied on coarse-grained phenomenological descriptions of actomyosin networks as active fluids, whose motions are driven by gradients of active contractile stress and opposed by an effectively viscous resistance\cite{cellmech_flows}.  In these models, spatial variation in active stress is typically assumed to reflect spatial variation in motor activity and force transmission\cite{PhysRevLett.106.028103}, while viscous resistance is assumed to reflect the internal dissipation of elastic resistance due to local remodeling of filaments and/or cross-links\cite{Salbreux2012536, De-La-Cruz:2015aa}. Models combining an active fluid description with simple kinetics for network assembly and disassembly, can successfully reproduce the spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical flow observed during polarization \cite{cellmech_flows}, cell division \cite{Turlier2014114,PhysRevLett.103.058102}, cell motility \cite{Keren:2009aa,RevModPhys.85.1143} and tissue morphogenesis \cite{Behrndt257}. However, it remains a challenge to connect this coarse-grained description of cortical flow to the microscopic origins of force generation and dissipation within cross-linked actomyosin networks. 


Much of the recent theoretical interest in cortical flow centers on the biological context of pattern formation.  In particular, in the developing \textit{C. elegans} embryo, an initial small asymmetry is magnified by cortical flow to produce a global polarized cell\cite{Munro2004413}.  This global polarization from mechanical flow constitutes a mechanism of macroscopic pattern formation beyond the conventional Turing reaction-diffusion mechanism\cite{Howard2011}. Therefore, it becomes all the more important to elucidate the specific micromechanical mechanisms that make it possible for a system to exhibit acive fluid-like properties.


To understand how cells exert physiological control over cortical deformation and flow, or to build and tune networks with desired properties {\em in vitro}, it is essential to connect this coarse-grained description to the microscopic origins of force generation and dissipation within cross-linked actomyosin networks.  Both active stress and effective viscosity depend sensitively on microscopic parameters including densities of filaments, motors and cross-links, force-dependent motor/filament interactions, cross-link dynamics and network turnover rates.  Thus a key challenge is to understand how tuning these microscopic parameters controls the dynamic interplay between active force generation and passive relaxation to control macroscopic dynamics of cortical flow.


\section{Rheology and Theory of Semi-flexible Cross-linked Networks}

Cross-linked networks of semi-flexible polymers are a class of materials with poorly understood but highly interesting properties.    Early studies of semi-flexible polymer networks reconstituted {\em in vitro} revealed novel, nonlinear rheology, spurring interest from materials scientists\cite{megareview}.  Cross-linked networks of cytoskeletal polymers have been a subject of great interest to biologists because of their importance as structural components of cells\cite{cellmech_review1,cellmech_review2}.


On shorter timescales, the response of cross-linked polymer networks to applied stress can be well-described theoretically in terms of purely elastic mechanical resistance.  On longer timescales, the network's elastic resistance begins to give way to a viscous relaxation of stored stress, but the mechanisms that govern this viscous relaxation remain poorly understood.   It is important to understand the mechanism behind this long timescale relaxation of cross-linked polymer networks both for understanding their novel material properties as well as understanding how this effect may govern physiologically important cellular processes\cite{cell_rheo}.


For {\em in vitro} reconstitutions, this viscous relaxation is thought to result from transient unbinding and rebinding of intermolecular cross-links\cite{rheo_crosslinksmatter,theo_crosslinkslip1}. However, there is still no clear understanding of how local relaxations of network connectivity would give rise to a global viscous relaxation.  In our work, we wish to expand upon a well-established mechanical picture of cross-linked semi-flexible polymer networks to incorporate slippage of cross-links over longer timescales.  


\section{Short Timescale Mechanics of Cross-linked Actin Filament Networks}


Early {\em in vitro}  studies of cross-linked actin filament networks revealed strikingly different elastic behaviors compared to the already well-understood flexible polymer gels \cite{rheo_bench}.  The complexity of these behaviors drove a surge in both experimental and theoretical studies of semi-flexible networks.  For a comprehensive review of this field we recommend \cite{megareview}, but we will shortly repeat some important milestones here.

\subsection{Theories of Semi-flexible Filament Networks}
 
Diversity and discrepancy in observations led a drive toward systematic {\em in vitro} experimental explorations of the rheology of cross-linked semi-flexible polymer networks at short timescales.  In studies with rigid irreversibly cross-linked networks, it was found that differences in network structure could lead to remarkably different elastic moduli, suggesting distinct phases of mechanical response \cite{rheo_marge}.  These discoveries in turn begat theoretical work on the basic implications of the semi-flexible nature of filaments on network mechanics.  

Prior work on the basic physics of individual semi-flexible polymers \cite{mol_wlc,theo_doi_ed}, and comprehensive theories of semi-flexible filament solutions, \cite{theo_morse} laid a groundwork for theoretical considerations of cross-linked networks. Beginning with the so-called "mikado model" descriptions\cite{theo_hlm,theo_hlm2}, it was determined that there should exist a minimum rigidity percolation threshold, and that the connectivity of the network determined whether the mechanical response was dominated by non-affine bending or affine stretching of filaments.   Continuing to more explicit theories\cite{theo_best}, the mechanics of rigidly cross-linked networks were shown to be well-described in terms of purely elastic stretching of filaments between cross-linked points.  

\subsection{Incorporating Effects of Cross-link Compliance}

Despite the success of the theory for rigid cross-links, early studies showed that surprising qualitative differences in mechanical response could be traced to differences in the chosen cross-linker\cite{rheo_crosslinkcompare,rheo_crosslinkreview}.  In addition, many studies using more compliant cross-linkers showed that cross-linker compliance could give rise to different nonlinear rheological properties on short timescales\cite{rheo_crosslink_nonlin1,rheo_crosslink_nonlin2,rheo_crosslink_nonlin3,rheo_crosslink_notactin}. Making matters even more complicated, ongoing research has begun to uncover added complexity from more highly complex issues such as filament bundling\cite{theo_crosslinkslip2,model_massive}and the effects of active cross-linking by molecular motors\cite{rheo_active}.

While theorists have built a number of largely successful models that help characterize different aspects of the cross-link dominated response\cite{theo_nonaffine2,theo_floppy,theo_crosslinknonlinear}, the diversity of behaviors of these networks makes a precise yet general theory more difficult.

\section{Long Timescale Stress Relaxation from Transient Cross-link Unbinding}

At long timescales, the purely elastic behavior of cross-linked networks gives way to fluid-like stress relaxation. Additionally, fluid-like flows have been observed in a number of cellular processes\cite{cellmech_flows,cellmech_flows2,cellmech_flows3,rheo_fluid,rheo_fluid2,cell_rheo_exp}.  In {\em in vitro} studies, long timescale creep behaviors are thought to arise predominantly from the transient nature of filament binding for most biologically relevant cross-linkers\cite{rheo_crosslinkslip1,rheo_crosslinkslip2,rheo_crosslinkslip3,rheo_nonaffine}.  While the importance of cross-link dynamics in determining the mechanical response of semi-flexible polymer networks has been known for at least 20 years\cite{rheo_crosslinksmatter}, there is still a gap in our understanding of how microscopic cross-link unbinding relates to viscous flows. 

\subsection{Models of Stress Relaxation with Transient Cross-links}

The dependence of network rheology on cross-link unbinding is an active subject of theoretical research\cite{theo_crosslinkslip2}.  Several theoretical methods have addressed cross-link binding and unbinding directly \cite{theo_crosslinkslip1,theo_crosslinkslip2} in analytical approaches that allowed well-constrained fits for specific cross-linkers.  These theories have therefore focused conceptually at the level of the cross-linked filament and were extended analytically to macroscopic networks.  In another approach, modelers have taken cross-links as extended springlike structures \cite{model_taeyoon} that are able to bind and unbind in simulated filament networks. Finally, other more ambitious simulations have even sought to interrogate the effects of cross-link unbinding in combination with the more complex mechanics of filament bundles\cite{rheo_crosslinkslip2,theo_crosslinkslip3}.

Ultimately, the complexity of the many theoretical approaches that have been applied to this problem have made it difficult to distinguish what, if any, core physical mechanisms may be sufficient to explain the observed forms of stress relaxation.  We believe that serious qualitative understanding can be generated by focusing on some of the common elements exhibited in the aforementioned literature.






\section{Goals of Thesis}

\subsection{Bridging the Theoretical Gap Between Active Fluids and Polymer Models}  The goal of this work is to build a computational bridge between the microscopic description of cross-linked actomyosin networks and the coarse grained macroscopic description of an active fluid.  We seek to capture the essential microscope features (dynamic cross-links, active motors and semi flexible actin filaments with asymmetric compliance and continuous filament recycling), but in a way that is sufficiently simple to allow systematic exploration of how parameters that govern network deformation and flow in an active fluid theory depend on microscopic parameters. To this end, we introduce several coarse-grained approximations into our representation of filament networks. First, we represent semi-flexible actin filaments as simple springs with asymmetric compliance (stronger in extension than compression). Second, we replace  dynamic binding/unbinding of elastic cross-links with a coarse-grained representation in terms of molecular friction \cite{theo_friction,theo_frictionSam,theo_molefric}, such that filaments can slide past each other against a constant fictional resistance. Third, we used a similar scheme to introduce active motors at filament crossover points with a simple linear force/velocity relationship, and we introduce dispersion of motor activity by making only a subset of filament overlaps active \cite{theo_frictionShila}.  Finally, we model filament turnover by allowing entire filaments to appear and disappear with a fixed probabilities per unit time. Importantly, these simplifications allow us to extend our single polymer models to dynamical systems of larger network models for direct comparison between theory and modeling results. This level of coarse graining will therefore make it easier to understand classes of behavior for varying compositions of cross-linked filament networks. In addition, it allows us to compute a new class of numerical simulations efficiently, which gives us concrete predictions for behaviors in widely different networks with measurable dependencies on molecular details. 

We use this model first to characterize the passive response of a cross-linked network to externally applied stress, then the buildup and maintenance of active stress against an external resistance, and finally the steady state flows produced by an asymmetric distribution of active motors in which active stress and passive resistance are dynamically balanced across the network.  Our results reveal how network remodeling can tune cortical flow through simultaneous effects on active force generation and passive resistance to network deformation. 

\subsection{Introducing Cross-link Slip Approach to Incorporating Cross-link turnover}

We introduce a coarse-grained representation of filament cross-linking in which cross-linked filaments are able to slide past each other as molecular bonds form and rupture, akin to coarse-grained models of molecular friction\cite{theo_friction,theo_frictionSam,theo_molefric}.  This drag-like coupling has been shown to be an adequate approximation in the case of ionic cross-linking of actin\cite{mol_fric,theo_hydroish2}, and can be found in the theoretical basis of force-velocity curves for myosin bound filaments\cite{theo_frictionShila}. We propose that it will form a suitable bulk approximation in the presence of supra-molecular cross-links as well.

Importantly, this simplification allows us to extend our single polymer models to dynamical systems of larger network models for direct comparison between theory and modeling results.  This level of coarse graining will therefore make it easier to understand classes of behavior for varying compositions of cross-linked filament networks.  In addition, it allows us to compute a new class of numerical simulations efficiently, which gives us concrete predictions for behaviors in widely different networks with measurable dependencies on molecular details.

\subsection{Elucidating the Importance of Filament Turnover}

The fundamental importance of actin filament turnover in setting the mechanical properties of a cell has been known to biologists for decades \cite{FEB2:FEB20014579387815132}. Nevertheless, theoretical investigators have only begun to explore the role of turnover quite recently \cite{2015arXiv150706182H,Mak:2016aa,10.1371/journal.pone.0000696} (see the final chapter of this thesis for a comparison of my current results with these recent publications). A major factor contributing to the slow advancement of our understanding of the role of turnover in cell mechanics is the difficulty in experimentation.  However, recent advances in experimental techniques of reconstituted systems should make turnover a viable avenue of study in the near future.  

Another major factor preventing the advancement of our understanding of turnover's impact on cell mechanics and dynamics is the complexity already inherent to our computational models of polymer systems at many length and time scales\cite{Mak2015}. In this work we wish to accelerate the interest in filament turnover as a fundamental contributor to cellular mechanics.  To do so, we will deemphasize the particularities of the polymer and cross-linker models and create a simplified generic model.  With this simplified model we will then be in a position to analyze the fundamental role of filament turnover.
