\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces smPReSS measurement technique. \textbf  {a)} The basic kinetic principle: during imaging, the level of surface-associated proteins is set by a dynamic balance of appearance (binding or assembly) at an observable rate $k_{app}$, disappearance (unbinding or disassembly) at a per-molecule rate $k_{off}$, and photobleaching at a per-molecule rate $k_{ph}$. \textbf  {b)} Predicted response of an initially unobserved cell at steady state to a step change in illumination. For an infinite cytoplasmic pool, the surface density relaxes to a new illuminated steady state. For a finite cytoplasmic pool, fast relaxation is accompanied by a slower decay caused by irreversible photobleaching. \textbf  {c)} Fast relaxation to a quasi-stable density during illumination is rapidly reversed when the laser is turned off. \textbf  {d)} Biphasic response for GFP::actin under illumination conditions that allow accurate single-molecule detection and tracking. Time from $t$ = 30-450 s is discontinuous. \textbf  {e)} Surface density of GFP::actin vs. time at various laser exposures, shown as a fraction of the initial unobserved density. Error bars, s.e.m. ($n$ = 7, 9, 6, 7 embryos for laser exposures from low to high). textbf{f)} Estimates of per-molecule turnover ($k_{off}$) and photobleaching ($k_{ph}$) rates as a function of laser exposure.
