    abstract = { The number of reports per year on single-molecule imaging experiments has grown roughly exponentially since the first successful efforts to optically detect a single molecule were completed over two decades ago. Single-molecule spectroscopy has developed into a field that includes a wealth of experiments at room temperature and inside living cells. The fast growth of single-molecule biophysics has resulted from its benefits in probing heterogeneous populations, one molecule at a time, as well as from advances in microscopes and detectors. This Perspective summarizes the field of live-cell imaging of single biomolecules. }

abstract={We describe a general, versatile and minimally invasive method to image single molecules near the cell surface that can be applied to any GFP-tagged protein in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. We exploited tunable expression via RNAi and a dynamically exchanging monomer pool to achieve fast, continuous single-molecule imaging at optimal densities with signal-to-noise ratios adequate for robust single-particle tracking (SPT). We introduce a method called smPReSS, single-molecule photobleaching relaxation to steady state, that infers exchange rates from quantitative analysis of single-molecule photobleaching kinetics without using SPT. Combining SPT and smPReSS allowed for spatially and temporally resolved measurements of protein mobility and exchange kinetics. We used these methods to (i) resolve distinct mobility states and spatial variation in exchange rates of the polarity protein PAR-6 and (ii) measure spatiotemporal modulation of actin filament assembly and disassembly. These methods offer a promising avenue to investigate dynamic mechanisms that pattern the embryonic cell surface.},

	abstract = {Pulsed actomyosin contractility underlies diverse modes of tissue morphogenesis, but the mechanisms that generate pulsed contractions are still poorly understood. Here, we combine quantitative imaging with genetic perturbations and mathematical modeling to identify a core mechanism for pulsed contractility in early C. elegans embryos. We show that pulsed accumulation of actomyosin is governed almost entirely by local control of assembly and disassembly downstream of RhoA. Pulsed activation and inactivation of RhoA precedes, respectively, the accumulation and disappearance of actomyosin, and persists in the near complete absence of Myosin II. Autocatalytic activation of RhoA underlies rapid pulse initiation, while delayed accumulation of the RhoA GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) RGA-3/4 provides negative feedback to terminate each pulse. Mathematical models, tightly constrained by our experiments, confirm that this combination of positive and negative feedback is sufficient to generate locally pulsatile RhoA dynamics and reproduce the observed waveform of RhoA activation and RGA-3/4 accumulation. We propose that excitable RhoA dynamics are a common driver for pulsed contractility that can be tuned or coupled to actomyosin dynamics in different ways to produce a diversity of morphogenetic outcomes.},
