\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.1}{\ignorespaces Networks with passive cross-links and no filament turnover undergo three stages of deformation in response to an extensional force. \textbf {a)} Three successive time points from a simulation of a $4\times 6.6\tmspace +\medmuskip {.2222em} \mu m$ network deforming under an applied extensional stress of 0.005 $nN/\mu m$ (stress is applied to filaments in the region indicated by the tan bar).
