(A) Measures of deformation rate vs time for the same data using three different metrics: (top) Rate of change in normalized surface area, (middle) material strain rate and (bottom) particle based strain rate (see materials and methods for details on how these were computed). (B) Measurements of single molecule number (top), appearance rate (middle) and disappearance rate (bottom) were aligned and averaged with respect to the onset of contraction, over 42 pulses, using the three metrics to measure deformation: change in normalized surface area (green), material strain rate (red), and particle-based strain rate (blue). Vertical dashed lines mark lowest actin density preceding the pulse. Horizontal dashed lines in top graph mark, respectively, the minimum number of actin molecules and the number of molecules at the onset of contraction. For all three metrics, the delay from actin minimum to contraction onset is $\delta $t $\approx $ 5s, and the relative change in number of molecules from minimum to contraction onset is $\delta $n $\approx $ 30$\%$. (C) Measurements of material strain rate, number of molecules, appearance rate and disappearance rate, aligned and averaged with respect to the end of contraction for the same data shown in A\&B. (D) Measurements of particle-based strain rate, number of molecules, appearance rate and disappearance rate, aligned and averaged with respect to the onset of contraction, in wild type (blue, n = 42 pulses) and \textit {arx-2}(RNAi) (red, n = 49 pulses) embryos. (E) Left column: number of molecules relative to average in wild type (blue) and \textit {arx-2}(RNAi) (red) embryos, as previously displayed in (D).
