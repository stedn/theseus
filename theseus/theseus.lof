Decreasing filament lifetimes reduces stress dissipation by replacing compressed with uncompressed filaments, allowing higher levels of steady state stress; for very short lifetimes, stress is reduced, because individual filaments do not have time to build stress before turning over. \textbf {C)} Plots of $\approx $steady state stress estimated from the simulations in \textbf {B)} vs turnover time. \textbf {D)} Plot of normalized steady state stress vs normalized recycling time for a wide range of network parameters and turnover times. Steady state stress is normalized by the predicted maximum stress $\sigma _{m}$ achieved in the absence of filament turnover. Turnover time is normalized by the predicted time to achieve maximum stress $\tau _{m}$, in the absence of filament turnover.
