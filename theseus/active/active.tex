\section{Results}
The goal of this study is to understand how cortical flow is shaped by the simultaneous dependencies of active stress and effective viscosity on filament turnover, crosslink drag and on ``network parameters'' that control  filament density, elasticity and motor activity.   We approach this in three steps: First, we analyze the passive deformation of a cross-linked network in response to an externally applied stress; we identify regimes in which the network response is effectively viscous and characterize the dependence of effective viscosity on network parameters and filament turnover.  Second, we analyze the buildup and dissipation of active stress in cross-linked networks with active motors, as they contract against an external resistance; we identify conditions under which the network can produce sustained stress at steady state, and characterize how steady state stress depends on network parameters and filament turnover. Finally, we confirm that the dependencies of active stress and effective viscosity on network parameters and filament turnover are sufficient to predict the dynamics of networks undergoing steady state flow in response to spatial gradients of motor activity.

% Example of passive simulation measurements
\paragraph{Networks with passive cross-links and no filament turnover undergo three stages of deformation in response to an extensional force.} 

To characterize the passive response of a cross-linked filament network without filament recycling, we simulated a simple uniaxial strain experiment in which we pinned the network at one end, imposed an external stress at the opposite end, and then quantified network strain and internal stress as a function of time (Fig. \ref{fig:model_overview}E). The typical response occurred in three qualitatively distinct phases (Fig. \ref{fig:passive_ex}A,C). At short times the response was viscoelastic, with a rapid buildup of internal stress and a rapid $\sim$exponential approach to a fixed strain (\nameref{fig:passive_supp}A), which represents the elastic limit in the absence of cross-link slip predicted by \cite{theo_hlm}. At intermediate times, the local stress and strain rate were approximately constant across the network (Fig. \ref{fig:passive_ex}B), and the response was effectively viscous; internal stress remained ~constant while the network continued to deform slowly and continuously with nearly constant strain rate (shown as dashed line in Fig. \ref{fig:passive_ex}C) as filaments slip past one another against the effective cross-link drag. In this regime, we can quantify effective viscosity, $\eta_c$,  as the ratio of applied stress to the measured strain rate. Finally, as the network strain approached a critical value ($\sim 30\%$ for the simulation in Fig. \ref{fig:passive_ex}), strain thinning lead to decreased network connectivity, local tearing, and rapid acceleration of the network deformation (see inset in Fig. \ref{fig:passive_ex}C).

% Viscosity and timescale parameter dependence
\paragraph{Network architecture sets the rate and timescales of deformation.}  To characterize how effective viscosity and the timescale for transition to effectively viscous behavior depend on network architecture and cross-link dynamics, we simulated a uniaxial stress test, holding the applied stress constant, while varying filament length $L$, density $l_c$,  elastic modulus $\mu_e$ and cross link drag $\xi$ (see \nameref{S1_Table}). We measured the elastic modulus, $G_0$, the effective viscosity, $\eta_c$, and the timescale $\tau_c$ for transition from viscoelastic to effectively viscous behavior, and compared these to theoretical predictions. We observed a transition from viscoelastic to effectively viscous deformation for the entire range of parameter values that we sampled.  Our estimate of $G_0$ from simulation agreed well with the closed form solution  $G_0 \sim \mu/l_c$ predicted by a previous theoretical model \cite{theo_hlm} for networks of semi-flexible filaments with irreversible cross-links (Fig. \ref{fig:passive_form}B). 

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

A simple theoretical analysis of filament networks with frictional cross link slip, operating in the intermediate viscous regime (see \nameref{S1_Text} A.2), predicted that the effective viscosity $\eta_c$ should be proportional to the cross-link drag coefficient and to the square of the number of cross-links per filament:

\begin{equation}
	\eta_c = 4\pi\xi\left ( \frac{L}{l_c}-1\right )^2
\end{equation}


As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:passive_form}B, our simulations agree well with this prediction for a large range of sampled network parameters. Finally, for many linear viscoelastic materials, the ratio of effective viscosity to the elastic modulus $\eta_c/G_0$ sets the timescale for transition from elastic to viscous behavior\cite{mccrum1997principles}. Combining our approximations for $G_0$ and $\eta_c$, we predict a transition time, $\tau_c \approx L^2\xi/l_c\mu$. Measuring the time at which the strain rate became nearly constant (i.e. $\gamma \sim t^n$ with $n>0.8$) yields an estimate of $\tau_c$ that agrees well with this prediction over the entire range of sampled parameters (Fig. \ref{fig:passive_form}C).  Thus the passive response of filament networks with frictional cross link drag is well-described on short (viscoelastic) to intermediate (viscous) timescales by an elastic modulus $G_0$, an effective viscosity $\eta_c$, and a transition timescale $\tau_c$, with well-defined dependencies on network parameters. However, without filament turnover, strain thinning and network tearing limits the extent of viscous deformation to small strains.

% Passive Recycling
\paragraph{Filament turnover allows sustained large-scale viscous flow and defines two distinct flow regimes.} 


To characterize how filament turnover shapes the passive network response to an applied force, we introduced a simple form of turnover in which entire filaments disappear at a rate $k_{diss}\rho$, where $\rho$ is the filament density, and new unstrained filaments appear with a fixed rate per unit area, $k_{app}$. In a non-deforming network,  filament density will equilibrate to a steady state value, $\rho_0 = k_{ass}/k_{diss}$, with time constant $\tau_r = 1/k_{diss}$.  However, in networks deforming under extensional stress, the density will be set by a competition between strain thinning and density equilibration via turnover. 

We simulated a uniaxial stress test for different values of $\tau_r$, while holding all other parameters fixed (Fig. \ref{fig:passive_rec}A-C). For large $\tau_r$, as described above, the network undergoes strain thinning and ultimately tears.  Decreasing $\tau_r$ increases the rate at which the network equilibrates towards a steady state density $\rho_0$.  However, it also increases the rate of deformation and thus the rate of strain thinning (Fig. \ref{fig:passive_rec}B).  We found that the former effect dominates, such that below a critical value $\tau_r = \tau_{crit}$, the network can achieve a steady state characterized by a fixed density and a constant strain rate (\nameref{fig:thinning}).  Simple calculations (\nameref{S1_Text} A.3) show that the critical value of $\tau_r$ is approximately:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:syst3}
	\tau_{crit} = \frac{\xi {\left (\sqrt{\frac{L}{l_c}}-1 \right )}^3}{\sigma}.
\end{equation}

where  $\sigma$ is the applied stress, $L/l_c$ the linear cross link density, and $\xi$ is the effective crosslink drag.

\end{figure}

For $\tau_r < \tau_{crit}$, we observed two distinct steady state flow regimes (Fig. \ref{fig:passive_rec}B,C). For intermediate values of $\tau_r$, effective viscosity remains ~constant with decreasing $\tau_r$.  However, below a certain value of  $\tau_r$ ($\approx 10^3$ for the parameters used in Fig. \ref{fig:passive_rec}C),  effective viscosity decreased monotonically with further decreases in $\tau_r$. To understand what sets the timescale for transition between these two regimes,  we measured effective viscosity at steady steady for a wide range of  network parameters ($L, \mu, {l_c}$), crosslink drags ($\xi$) and filament turnover times (Fig. \ref{fig:passive_rec}D). Strikingly, when we plotted the normalized effective viscosity $\eta_r/\eta_c$ vs a normalized recycling rate $\tau_r/\tau_c$ for all parameter values, the data collapsed onto a single curve, with a transition at  $\tau_r \approx \tau_c$  between an intermediate turnover regime in which effective viscosity is independent of $\tau_r$  and an high turnover regime in which effective viscosity falls monotonically with decreasing $~\tau_r/\tau_c$  (Fig. \ref{fig:passive_rec}D). 

This biphasic dependence of effective viscosity on filament turnover can be understood intuitively as follows:  As new filaments are born, they become progressively stressed as they stretch and reorient under local influence of surrounding filaments, eventually reaching an elastic limit where their contribution to resisting network deformation is determined by effective crosslink drag.  The time to reach this limit is about the same as the time, $\tau_c$, for an entire network of initially unstrained filaments to reach an elastic limit during the initial viscoelastic response to uniaxial stress, as shown in Fig. 2b.  For $\tau_r < \tau_c$, individual filaments do not have time, on average, to reach the elastic limit before turning over; thus the deformation rate is determined by the elastic resistance of partially strained filaments, which increases with lifetime up to $\tau_r = \tau_c$. For $\tau_r > \tau_c$, the deformation rate is largely determined by cross-link resistance to sliding of maximally strained filaments, and the effective viscosity is insensitive to further increase in  $\tau_r$.

These results complement and extend a previous computational study of irreversibly cross-linked networks of treadmilling filaments deforming under extensional stress\cite{Kim2014526}. Kim et al identified two regimes of effectively viscous deformation: a ``stress-dependent'' regime in which filaments turnover before they become strained to an elastic limit and deformation rate is proportional to both applied stress and turnover rate; and a ``stress-independent'' regime in which filaments reach an elastic limit before turning over and deformation rate depends only on the turnover rate. The fast and intermediate turnover regimes that we observe here correspond to the stress-dependent and independent regimes described by Kim et al, but with a key difference. Without filament turnover, Kim et al's model predicts that a network cannot deform beyond its elastic limit.  In contrast, our model predicts viscous flow at low turnover, governed by an effective viscosity that is set by cross-link density and effective drag. Thus our model provides a self-consistent framework for understanding how crosslink unbinding and filament turnover contribute separately to viscous flow and connects these contributions directly to previous theoretical descriptions of cross-linked networks of semi-flexible filaments. 

In summary, our simulations predict that filament turnover allows networks to undergo viscous deformation indefinitely, without tearing, over a wide range of different effective viscosities and deformation rates. For $\tau_r < \tau_{crit}$, this behavior can be summarized by an equation of the form:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:simple_eta}
	\eta = \frac{\eta_c}{1+(\tau_c/\tau_r)^m}  
\end{equation}

For $\tau_r \gg \tau_c$, $\eta\approx\eta_c$: effective viscosity depends on crosslink density and effective crosslink drag, independent of changes in recycling rate. For $\tau_r\ll\tau_c$,  effective viscosity is governed by the level of elastic stress on network filaments, and becomes strongly dependent on filament lifetime: $\eta\sim\eta_c(\tau_r/\tau_c)^m$. The origins of the $m = 3/4$ scaling remains unclear (see Discussion).




% ACTIVE SECTION
\subsection{Filament turnover allows persistent stress buildup in active networks}

\paragraph{In the absence of filament turnover, active networks with free boundaries contract and then stall against passive resistance to network compression.}


Previous work \cite{1367-2630-14-3-033037,rheo_2D1,rheo_active} identifies asymmetric filament compliance and spatial heterogeneity in motor activity as minimal requirements for macroscopic contraction of disordered networks. To confirm that our simple implementation of these two requirements (see Models section) is sufficient for macroscopic contraction, we simulated active networks that are unconstrained by external attachments, varying filament length, density, crosslink drag and motor activity.  We observed qualitatively similar results for all choices of parameter values:  Turning on motor activity in an initially unstrained network induced rapid initial contraction, followed by a slower buildup of compressive stress (and strain) on individual filaments, and an $\sim$exponential approach to stall (Fig. \ref{fig:active_con}). The time to stall, $\tau_s$, scaled as $L\xi/\upsilon$ (\nameref{fig:active_supp}A). On even longer timescales, polarity sorting of individual filaments, as previously described \cite{Reymann1310,Murrell15062014,Ndlec:1997aa,Surrey1167} lead to network expansion (see \nameref{active_con_video}).


\begin{figure}[H]

Note that extensional and compressive stress remain balanced as compressive resistance builds during network contraction.}
\end{figure}

During the rapid initial contraction, the increase in network strain closely matched the increase in mean compressive strain on individual filaments Fig. \ref{fig:active_con}B, as predicted theoretically \cite{1367-2630-14-3-033037,PhysRevX.4.041002} and observed experimentally\cite{rheo_2D1}. Contraction required asymmetric filament compliance and spatial heterogeneity of motor activity ($\mu_e/\mu_c > 1$, $\phi<1$, \nameref{fig:active_supp}B). Thus our model captures a minimal mechanism for bulk contractility in disordered networks through asymmetric filament compliance and dispersion of motor activity. However, in the absence of turnover, contraction is limited by internal buildup of compressive resistance and the dissipative effects of polarity sorting.


\paragraph{Active networks cannot sustain stress against a fixed boundary in the absence of filament turnover.}

During cortical flow, regions with high motor activity contract against a passive resistance from neighboring regions with lower motor activity.  To understand how the active stresses that drive cortical flow are shaped by motor activity and network remodeling, we analyzed the buildup and maintenance of contractile stress in active networks contracting against a rigid boundary. We simulated active networks contracting from an initially unstressed state against a fixed boundary (Fig. \ref{fig:active_str}A,B), and  monitored the time evolution of mean extensional (blue), compressional (red) and total (black) stress on network filaments (Fig. \ref{fig:active_str}C,D). We focused initially on the scenario in which there is no, or very slow, filament turnover, sampling a range of parameter values controlling filament length and density, motor activity, and crosslink drag. 

\begin{figure}[H]

Note the different time scales used for plots and subplots in \textbf{C)} and \textbf{D)} to emphasize the similar timescales for force buildup, but very different timescales for force dissipation.}
\end{figure}

We observed a similar behavior in all cases: total stress built rapidly to a peak value $\sigma_m$, and then decayed towards zero (Fig. \ref{fig:active_str}C,D).  The rapid initial increase in total stress was determined largely by the rapid buildup of extensional stress (Fig. \ref{fig:active_str}C,D) on a subset of network filaments (Fig. \ref{fig:active_str}A,B $t=10s$). The subsequent decay involved two different forms of local remodeling: under some conditions, e.g. for higher motor activity (e.g. Fig. \ref{fig:active_str}A,C), the decay was associated with rapid local tearing and fragmentation, leading to global loss of network connectivity as described previously both in simulations\cite{Mak:2016aa} and {\em in vitro}  experiments \cite{Alvarado:2013aa}.  However, for many parameters, (e.g. for higher motor activity  as in Fig. \ref{fig:active_str}B,D), the decay in stress occurred with little or no loss of global connectivity.  Instead, local filament rearrangements changed the balance of extensile vs compressive forces along individual filaments, leading to a slow decrease in the average extensional stress, and a correspondingly slow increase in the compressional stress, on individual filaments (see Fig. \ref{fig:active_str}D).  

Combining dimensional analysis with trial and error, we were able to find empirical scaling relationships describing the dependence of maximum stress $\sigma_m$ and the time to reach maximum stress $\tau_m$ on network parameters and effective crosslink drag  ($\sigma_m \sim \sqrt{\mu_e\upsilon}/l_c$, $\tau_m\sim L\xi/\sqrt{\mu_e\upsilon}$, \nameref{fig:active_supp}C,D). Although these relationships should be taken with a grain of salt, they are reasonably consistent with our simple intuition that the peak stress should increase with motor force ($\upsilon$), extensional modulus ($\mu_e$) and filament density ($1/l_c$), and the time to reach peak stress should increase with crosslink drag ($\xi$) and decrease with motor force ($\upsilon$) and extensional modulus ($\mu_e$).  

\paragraph{Filament turnover allows active networks to exert sustained stress on a fixed boundary.}

Regardless of the exact scaling dependencies of $\sigma_m$ and $\tau_m$ on network parameters, these results reveal a fundamental limit on the ability of active networks to sustain force against an external resistance in the absence of filament turnover.  To understand how this limit can be overcome by filament turnover, we simulated networks contracting against a fixed boundary from an initially unstressed state, for increasing rates of filament turnover (decreasing $\tau_r$), while holding all other parameter values fixed (Fig. \ref{fig:active_rec}A-C). While the peak stress decreased monotonically with decreasing $\tau_r$, the steady state stress showed a biphasic response, increasing initially with decreasing $\tau_r$, and then falling off as $\tau_r \to 0$.  We observed a biphasic response regardless of how stress decays in the absence of turnover, i.e. whether decay involves loss of network connectivity, or local remodeling without loss of connectivity, or both (\nameref{fig:active_tear} and not shown). Significantly, when we plot normalized steady state stress ($\sigma/\sigma_m$) vs normalized recycling time ($\tau_r$/$\tau_m$) for a wide range of network parameters, the data collapse onto a single biphasic response curve, with a peak near $\tau_r/\tau_m = 1$ (Fig. \ref{fig:active_rec}D). In particular, for $\tau_r < \tau_m$, the scaled data collapsed tightly onto a single curve representing a linear increase in steady state stress with increasing $\tau_r$. For $\tau_r > \tau_m$, the scaling was less consistent, although the trend towards a monotonic decrease with increasing $\tau_r$ was clear. These results reveal that filament turnover can rescue the dissipation of active stress during isometric contraction due to network remodeling, and they show that, for a given choice of network parameters, there is an optimal choice of filament lifetime that maximizes steady state stress.

Dashed blue line indicates the approximation given in equation \ref{eqn:simple_sigma} for $n=1$.}
\end{figure}

We can understand the biphasic dependence of steady state stress on filament lifetime using the same reasoning applied to the case of passive flow:   During steady state contraction, the average filament should build and dissipate active stress on approximately the same schedule as an entire network contracting from an initially unstressed state (Fig. \ref{fig:active_rec}B). Therefore for $\tau_r < \tau_m$, increasing lifetime should increase the mean stress contributed by each filament. For $\tau_r > \tau_m$, further increases in lifetime should begin to reduce the mean stress contribution. Directly comparing the time-dependent buildup and dissipation of stress in the absence of turnover, with the dependence of steady state stress on $\tau_r$, supports this interpretation (\nameref{fig:recycle_supp})  


As for the passive response (i.e. Equation \ref{eqn:simple_eta}), we can describe this biphasic dependence phenomenologically with an equation of the form:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:simple_sigma}
	\sigma_{ss} = \frac{\sigma_m}{(\tau_r/\tau_m)^n+\tau_m/\tau_r}  
\end{equation}

where the origins of the exponent $n$ remain unclear.




% COMBINED SECTION
\subsection{Filament turnover tunes the balance between active stress buildup and viscous stress relaxation to generate flows}

Thus far, we have considered independently how network remodeling controls the passive response to an external stress, or the steady state stress produced by active contraction against an external resistance. We now consider how these two forms of dependence will combine to shape steady state flow produced by spatial gradients of motor activity. We consider a simple scenario in which a network is pinned on either side and motor activity is continuously patterned such that the right half network has uniformly high levels of motor activity (controlled by $\upsilon$, with $\psi = 0.5$), while the left half network has none. Under these conditions, the right half network will contract continuously against a passive resistance from the left half network.  Because of asymmetric filament compliance, the internal resistance of the right half network to active compression should be negligible compared to the external resistance of the left half network.  Thus the steady state flow will be described by:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:everybody_knows}
	\dot{\gamma} = \frac{\sigma_{ss}}{\eta}  
\end{equation}


where $\sigma_{ss}$ is the active stress generated by the right half-network (less the internal resistance to filament compression), $\eta$ is the effective viscosity of the left half network and strain rate $\dot{\gamma}$ is measured in the left half-network.  Note that strain rate can be related to the steady state flow velocity $v$ at the boundary between right and left halves through $ v = \dot{\gamma}Dx$. Therefore, we can understand the dependence of flow speed on filament turnover and other parameters using the approximate relationships summarized by equations \ref{eqn:simple_eta} and \ref{eqn:simple_sigma} for $\eta$ and $\sigma_{ss}$.  As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:flow_theo}, there are two qualitatively distinct possibilities for the dependence of strain rate on $\tau_r$, depending on the relative magnitudes of $\tau_m$ and $\tau_c$.  In both cases, for fast enough turnover ($\tau_r < \min \left (\tau_m, \tau_c \right )$), we expect weak dependence of strain rate on $\tau_r$ ($ \dot{\gamma}\sim \tau_r^{1/4}$).  For all parameter values that we sampled in this study (which were chosen to lie in a physiological range), $\tau_m > \tau_c$. Therefore we predict the dependence of steady state strain rate on $\tau_r$ shown in Fig. \ref{fig:flow_theo}A.


\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=\hsize]{active/figures/Fig8}

\end{figure}

To confirm this prediction, we simulated the simple scenario described above for a range of values of $\tau_r$, with all other parameter values initially fixed. As expected, we observed a sharp dependence of steady state flow speeds on filament recycling rate (Fig. \ref{fig:flow_ex}B,C). For very long recycling times, ($\tau_r=1000 s$, dark blue line), there was a rapid initial deformation (contraction of the active domain and dilation of the passive domain), followed by a slow approach to a steady state flow characterized by slow contraction of the right half-domain and a matching dilation of the left half-domain (see \nameref{fig:combo_prof}).  However, with decreasing values of $\tau_r$, steady state flow speeds increased steadily, before reaching an approximate plateau on which flow speeds varied by less than 15 \% over more than two decades of variation in $\tau_r$ (Fig. \ref{fig:flow_ex}C).

We repeated these simulations for a wider range of parameter values, and saw similar dependence of $\dot{\gamma}$ on $\tau_r$ in all cases.  Using equation \ref{eqn:simple_eta} with $\tau_r < \tau_c$ and equation \ref{eqn:simple_sigma} with $\tau_r < \tau_m$, and the theoretical or empirical scaling relationships found above for $\eta_c$, $\tau_c$, $\sigma_m$ and $\tau_m$, we predict a simple scaling relationship for $\dot{\gamma}$ (for small $\tau_r$):


\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:flow_scaling_eq}
	\dot{\gamma} = \frac{\upsilon}{\xi L}  \left ( \tau_r \right ) ^{1/4}
\end{equation}

Indeed, when we plot the steady state measurements of $\dot{\gamma}$, normalized by $\upsilon/\xi L$,  for all parameter values, the data collapse onto a single curve for small $\tau_r$.  Thus. our simulations identify a flow regime, characterized by sufficiently fast filament turnover, in which the steady state flow speed is buffered against variation in turnover, and has a relatively simple dependence on other network parameters.



%Conclusion
\section{Discussion}

\paragraph{} Cortical flows arise through a dynamic interplay of force production and dissipation within cross-linked actomyosin networks. Here we combined computer simulations with simple theoretical analysis to explore how this interplay depends on motor activity, crosslink dynamics, network architecture and filament turnover. Our results reveal two essential requirements for filament turnover during cortical flow:  (a) to allow the continuous relaxation of elastic resistance without catastrophic loss of network connectivity and (b) to prevent the dissipation of active stress through local network rearrangements. We find that biphasic dependencies of active stress and passive relaxation on filament lifetime define multiple modes of steady state flow with distinct dependencies on network parameters and filament turnover.


\paragraph{} We identify two distinct modes of passive response to uniaxial stress:  a low turnover mode in which filaments strain to an elastic limit before turning over, and effective viscosity depends on crosslink density and effective crosslink friction, and a high turnover mode in which filaments turn over before reaching an elastic limit and effective viscosity is proportional to elastic resistance and $\approx$ proportional to filament lifetime. We note that the weakly sub-linear dependence of effective viscosity on filament lifetime that we observe in the high turnover regime may simply reflect a failure to capture very local modes of filament deformation, since a previous study \cite{Kim2014526} in which filaments were represented as connected chains of smaller segments predicted linear dependence of effective viscosity on filament lifetime. While previous studies have emphasized individual roles for cross-link unbinding or filament turnover in stress relaxation \cite{De-La-Cruz:2015aa,De-La-Cruz:2009aa,Salbreux2012536}, here we have capture their distinct contributions within a single self-consistent modeling framework. 

\paragraph{} Our simulations confirm the theoretical prediction \cite{1367-2630-14-3-033037,rheo_2D1,rheo_active} that spatial heterogeneity of motor activity and asymmetric filament compliance are sufficient to support macroscopic contraction of unconstrained networks. However, under isometric conditions, and without filament turnover, our simulations predict that active stress cannot be sustained. On short timescales, motor forces drive local buildup of extensional stress, but on longer timescales, active local filament rearrangements drive local changes in connectivity that lead, invariably, to a decay in active stress.  Under some conditions, contractile forces drive networks towards a critically connected state, leading to tearing and fragmentation, as previously described \cite{Alvarado:2013aa, Mak:2016aa}. However, we find that stress decay can also occur without any global loss of connectivity, through a gradual decrease in extensile force and a gradual increase in compressive force along individual filaments.   Our results suggest that when filaments can slide relative to one another, the motor forces that produce active stress will inevitably lead to local changes in connectivity that decrease active stress.  Thus for contractile networks to maintain isometric tension on long timescales, they must either form stable crosslinks to prevent filament rearrangements, or they must continuously recycle network filaments (or active motors) to renew the local potential for production of active stress.

\paragraph{} Indeed, our simulations predict that filament turnover is sufficient for maintenance of active stress. As in the passive case, they predict biphasic dependence of steady state stress on filament turnover: For short-lived filaments ($\tau_r < \tau_m$), steady state stress increases linearly with filament lifetime because filaments have more time to build towards peak extensional stress before turning over.  For longer loved filaments ($\tau_r > \tau_m$), steady state stress decreases monotonically with filament lifetime because local rearrangements decrease the mean contributions of longer lived filaments. These findings imply that for cortical networks that sustain contractile stress under approximately isometric conditions, tuning filament turnover can control the level of active stress, and there will be an optimal turnover rate that maximizes the stress, all other things equal.  This may be important, for example in early development, where contractile forces produced by cortical actomyosin networks maintain, or drive slow changes in, cell shape and tissue geometry \cite{Salbreux2012536,Gorfinkiel2011531}.


\paragraph{} For cortical networks that undergo steady state flows driven by spatial gradients of motor activity, our simulations predict that the biphasic dependencies of steady state stress and effective viscosity on filament lifetime define multiple regimes of steady state flow, characterized by different dependencies on filament turnover (and other network parameters).  In particular, the $\sim$linear dependencies of steady state stress and effective viscosity on filament lifetime for short-lived filaments define a fast turnover regime in which steady state flow speeds are buffered against variations in filament lifetime, and are predicted to depend in a simple way on motor activity and crosslink resistance.  Measurements of F-actin turnover times in cells that undergo cortical flow \cite{Theriot1991,Murthy2016,Watanabe1083,Guha2016,Fritzsche15032013,Robin:2014aa} suggests that they may indeed operate in this fast turnover regime, and recent studies in {\em C. elegans} embryos suggests that cortical flow speeds are surprisingly insensitive to depletion of factors (ADF/Cofilin) that govern filament turnover \cite{cellmech_flows}, consistent with our model's predictions. Stronger tests of our model's predictions will require more systematic analyses of how flow speeds vary with filament and crosslink densities, motor activities, and filament lifetimes.
