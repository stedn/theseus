A) Effective viscosity of rigid polymer networks in the presence of friction-like crosslink slippage
	Fig 1) connectivity of networks depends on network slippage
		A phase diagram showing how density and slippage rate work together to determine whether a network is in a connected or disconnected regime.
	Fig 2) typical frequency dependence of G
		just a graph showing the normalized frequency dependent moduli for 3 different architectures and slip rates
	Fig 3) timescale of effective viscosity is architecture dependent
		A graph showing the collapse of effective viscosities onto a single curve
		predicting that the effective viscosity should have an analytical form at high density & moderate slip rate, but that there should be a falloff as density drops and slip rate increases.
	Fig 4) characteristic domain size of network tearing
		A graph showing that as effective viscosity is lowered you eventually see disconnected regimes of various sizes
